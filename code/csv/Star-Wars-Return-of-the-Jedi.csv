Where am I?
Who are you?The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.
Leia!
What's that? I know that laugh.The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.Jabba laughs.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.
Look...JABBA (cont Huttese subtitled)Take him away!The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead Leia away.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)Bring her to me.Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly turns away in disgust.
Chewie? Chewie, is that you?The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, revealing Chewie.
Ah! Chew--Chewie!The giant Wookiee barks with glee.
Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?Chewie barks an excited blue streak.
Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.Chewie barks a reply.
A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.
I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
How are we doing?
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?Luke looks to Leia.
Good, I hate long waits.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?Chewie barks his agreement.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Oh... great!
Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?Chewie growls his agreement.
Chewie, you okay? Where is he?The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.
I'm okay, pal.For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from the wrist down. Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable and stands free.Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.
Lando!Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating the guards from their midst.Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han, guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold of the spear.Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his arm, and aims his lethal appendage.Chewie barks desperately at Han.
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a weak congratulations to Han.
Lando, grab it!
I'm trying!A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.
Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the pit.
Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand moves him closer to his final reward.
Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let go of the spear.
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior, mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.LUKE (moving to his ship)I'll see you back at the fleet.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide)Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.
Good luck.Lando nods his thanks.
You're gonna need it.
Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers. Han looks up at him.
Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.HAN (smiles)That's one.
Luke.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She'sthe fastest ship in the fleet.
You, too.Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.
You got her warmed?
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him gently.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.LEIA (softly)Come on, General, let's move.Han snaps back to life.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
All right, hang on.
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.Chewie growls his agreement.CONTROLLER (over radio)We have you on our screen now. Please identify.
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.CONTROLLER (over radio)Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.
Transmission commencing.Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed transmission begins.
It'll work. It'll work.Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer that looms ever larger before them.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.Chewie barks a question.
I don't know. Fly casual.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out the window.
They're not goin' for it, Chewie.CONTROLLER (filtered)Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow yourpresent course.Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks worried. Chewie barks.
Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.Leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie start quietly down.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Hey, wait! Ahhh!He flips the remaining scout to the ground.
Luke! Where's Leia?LUKE (concerned)What? She didn't come back?
I thought she was with you.
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
What, Chewie? What? Chewie!The others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along, Artoo whistles nervously.
Hey, I don't get it.The rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.HAN (cont)Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Yeah, sure.Artoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an arm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to spin.
Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else.Han pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face. He grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.
Hey!
What are you telling them?
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Proper?!
Why, you--Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands placatingly.
My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
I have a really bad feeling about this.Chewie growls his concern.Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber with great curiosity.Logray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit under Han with firewood.
What did he say?
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
What's going on?
Just what I always wanted.Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket clings to Han's leg.HAN (chuckles)Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.
Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back.Han pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.HAN (cont)And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.
Hey, what's goin' on?Leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.
Ahhh...He starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.
I'm sorry.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.Wicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to Threepio.
Back door, huh? Good idea.Wicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.HAN (cont)It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.Han and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker. Threepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.
All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.The Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.
Charges! Come on, come on!Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at the door.THREEPIO (to Wicket)Oh, my! They'll be captured!Wicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into the forest.
Here's the terminal.LEIA (into comlink)Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of whistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, runs after him.
Come on! Come on!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
I think I got it. I got it!The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a second blast door crashes down in front of the first.Han frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her shoulder hit by a laser blast.
Let's see.
I love you.Another shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.
Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.
Throw me another charge.
Move! Move!A shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes along with the bunker.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
You love him, don't you?Leia smiles, puzzled.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.She realizes his misunderstanding.
","Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.Threepio is startled by this announcement.
I must speak with Jabba.Bib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.
You will take me to Jabba now!Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him into the gloom.
You serve your master well.Bib responds.
And you will be rewarded.
I must be allowed to speak.BIB (in Huttese subtitled)He must be allowed to speak.Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.Luke stares hard at Jabba.
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about the pit.
Han!
Are you all right?
Wouldn't miss it.
The same as always.
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.Jabba cackles evilly at this.As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look of conspiracy to him.
Easy, Chewie.At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately above the Sarlacc pit.
Point it at the deck!A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He flexes the hand; it still works.Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.
Come on!Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.
Let's go! And don't forget the droids.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.Luke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.
I'll meet you back at the fleet.LEIA (over comlink)Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
I will.HAN (over comlink)Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.
That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.
No... of course not.YODA (tickled, chuckles)I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger)When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Then I am a Jedi?YODA (shakes his head)Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his courage. Finally he is able to ask.
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.
Yoda, I must know.
Yes.A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face. He closes his eyes.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.YODA (gathering all his strength)No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Notready for the burden were you.
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
There's still good in him.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
But I had to help my friends.BEN (grinning at Luke's indignation)And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.LUKE (with sadness)I found out Darth Vader was my father.
I can't kill my own father.
Yoda spoke of another.
But I have no sister.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Hi, Han... Chewie.Artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.
Yeah, she's comin' up.Chewie growls a complaint.
All set.
Vader's on that ship.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.HAN (grins)Hey... it's me.Han and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. Luke and Leia exchange smiles.Han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.
I see them. Wait, Leia!But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.LUKE (pointing to the controls)Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely avoiding two huge trees.
Move closer!Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, slowing the scout.
Get alongside that one!Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the remaining scout.
Get him!The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a glancing hit.LUKE (indicating the one ahead)Keep on that one! I'll take these two!With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and rises out of sight.The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes a glancing hit.Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a conflagration.ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are moving as one.Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find Luke.Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.
We got separated.Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.
Hey, we better go look for her.Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.
Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners.Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the squad proceeds in another.
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.He tosses the helmet to Han.
Chewie, wa-wait! Don't!Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Han, don't. It'll be all right.The Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.
Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.Artoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free of the net and sits up, rattled.
Do you understand anything they're saying?
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Just tell them.Threepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to concentrate.
Thanks, Threepio.THREEPIO (still shaken)I...I never knew I had it in me.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
Tell me.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.LEIA (alarmed)How do you know?
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.(facing her)As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.(beat)I have to face him.Leia is distraught, confused.
He's my father.
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.
Yes. It's you Leia.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and comes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only now that she is crying.
I know, father.
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.VADER (indicating lightsaber)I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, brilliant blade.
Come with me.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate.
Then my father is truly dead.
You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.The Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke. The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can perceive the evil visage within the hood.
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.The Emperor laughs.
Your overconfidence is your weakness.
No!
I will not fight you, father.Vader walks back up the stairs to Luke.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy menow.
I will not fight you.
Never-r-r!Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over theedge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi,like my father before me.The Emperor's glee turns to rage.
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
Father...I won't leave you.Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a shuttle.
","Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.Artoo whistles timidly.
Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.
Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.
Goodness gracious me! Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.
Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his concern.
I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at one another, afraid to enter.Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.
Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this.Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.
Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.THREEPIO (cont)...and a gift.(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)Gift, what gift?Bib shakes his head negatively.
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.Bib thinks about this for a moment.
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.Bib gestures for the droids to follow.
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.
Good morning.
The message, Artoo, the message.Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.
What did he say?LUKE (cont)... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.Luke's hologram disappears.Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)There will be no bargain.
We're doomed.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a carbonized HAN SOLO.
Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.
What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Oh. Well, yes.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Disintegrated?NINEDENINE (to a Gamorrean guard)Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.THREEPIO (disappearing)Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps angrily.
Oh, no! Chewbacca!JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices BOBA FETT standing near the door.
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand.BOUSHH (in Ubese subtitled)I want fifty thousand. No less.Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?(to Boushh)Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.Jabba continues.
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes dead.
He agrees!The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly appreciative creatures.Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
Master Luke, you're standing on...JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his hand.
Oh, no! The Rancor!At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers and laughs at the guard's fate.The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an avalanche.The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it down on the Rancor's finger.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.HAN (to Luke)Doesn't sound so bad.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?Artoo beeps a quick reply.
Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!Artoo whistles a singsong response.
Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye dangling from a wire) hurry off.
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, tumbling toward the sand.Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she has brought around to point down at the deck.
Sounds dangerous.LEIA (to Han)I wonder who they found to pull that off.
""Exciting"" is hardly the word I would use.
Here we go again.
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked nearby.
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.
Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do.They move off into the woods.THREEPIO (to Artoo)And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
Oh, Master Luke.
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.HAN (gravely)I hope she's alright.Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off through the foliage.
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long spear.
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks begin to chant at Threepio.
Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms ofcommunication.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. ButI do believe they think I am some sort of god.Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange ""what next?"" looks.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at abanquet in my honor.The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening at the same moment the prisoners see her.HAN and LUKELeia!As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.
Your Royal Highness.Artoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the assembled Ewoks and sighs.
But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...Now the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.
... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio calling out in total panic at his situation.
Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and marveling at his height.
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer and screeches.
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
I have decided that we shall stay here.
Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.Inside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial commander enters.
Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?
Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?
We surrender.The stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a band of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.
Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.In a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and their awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting Ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the trees above.In the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes to the bunker door control panel.
Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.A group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.A line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged behind.Two speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between two trees.
We're coming!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn around to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in his body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded companion.
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Oh, dear.
They did it!Han looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face. Leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent voice.
","You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring himbefore me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of theForce.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial troops.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, LordVader.Vader knows what is being asked.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.VADER (skeptical)He will come to me?
I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me.VADER (bows)As you wish.The Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.
Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.Luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down at Luke's binders.
You no longer need those.The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands, free now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.
Guards, leave us.The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.EMPEROR (to Luke)I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.Luke looks up sharply.
Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.Vader looks at Luke.
Your faith in your friends is yours.
Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
Come, boy. See for yourself.The Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side. Luke moves to look through a small section of the window.
From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion.Luke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest of the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the lightsaber.
You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant.Vader watches Luke in his agony.
It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!
As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.(into comlink)Fire at will, Commander.Luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the Rebel fleet beyond.
Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends.Luke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.
Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his father.
Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father'splace at my side!Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.
So be it...Jedi.
If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the Force to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.
Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.Luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.
Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price foryour lack of vision.Luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward where Vader stands watching.LUKE (groans)Father, please. Help me.Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, then back to Luke on the floor.
Now, young Skywalker...you will die.Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move.
","You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back onschedule.The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.JERJERROD (aghast)The Emperor's coming here?
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Yes, my Master.
As you wish.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Yes, my Master.Vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks toward the waiting council members.
Where is that shuttle going?PIETT (into comlink)Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?PILOT VOICE (HAN) (filtered)Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.The Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.
Do they have a code clearance?
No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.PIETT (surprised)As you wish, my lord.(to controller)Carry on.Piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.
(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the Force)The Emperor will see me, now!
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.EMPEROR (no surprise)Yes, I know.VADER (after a beat)My son is with them.EMPEROR (very cool)Are you sure?
I have felt him, my Master.
They are clear, my Master.
Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
So, you have accepted the truth.
Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.They stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.Luke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
If that is your destiny.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He isyour master now.Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring at one another for a long moment.
His lightsaber.Vader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's lightsaber. The Emperor takes it.
It is pointless to resist, my son.The Emperor turns to face Luke.EMPEROR (angry)Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. (indicates Endor)Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...Luke reacts. The Emperor notes it.EMPEROR (cont)...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.Luke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword in the Emperor's hand.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You are unwise to lower your defenses.Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader stands below him.
There is no conflict.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meetyour destiny.Vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's platform. Vader moves to find him.EMPEROR (laughs)Good. Good.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, yourthoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in anguish.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wanwas wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the darkside, then perhaps she will.
Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.Slowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the dying man smiles at the sight before him.ANAKIN (very weak)Now...go, my son. Leave me.
