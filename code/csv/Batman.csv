txt,"How'd you know it was me?
A nice, restful vacation. She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.
I do get hurt. She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then points to the scar and adds, slyly:
Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal here. What's new and hot in Gotham City?
(laughing) Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
Speaking of which... I hear the notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.
(straightening her clothes) No.
Yes, but please -- be gentle. Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.
Some. I
All over the world. They say he spends most of the year overseas -- until recently, anyway.
Just what I've heard. Rich. Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.
(smiling) Women find him magnetic.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
That's intriguing. They haven't been
Don't mind my friend. He's a little nervous tonight. KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's something formal, maybe even
As far as I know.
Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.
Yum, yum.
I get it. Bruce Vain. She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne.
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted? (standing up) Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
I told him yes. KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead. VICKI (cont.) You're awfully sweet to be concerned, but it's
Do you sail?
You do a very convincing imitation. (sipping her drink) Mm, this is tasty. What's yours? He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for her to try a sip. VICKI (cont.) ... Ginger ale?
... I guess I needed a change.
Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?
We went there once when I was little. I played on the beach. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced with my father on the hotel patio. (shrugging) That was Corto Maltese. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
... Terror. The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I know it all seems a million miles away, out here on the water, with all this --
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize
I'm happy to talk about something else. I don't want to be depressing.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are you like this with the other women you know? -- Because I just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
-- but it's not
God. You
... We could try that.
I didn't mean to scare you. I just had to come in here and see it that was really you
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is. -- Now you'll have to kill me. He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS. VICKI (cont.) Poor thing. You should stay off that horse.
... To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
(teasing him) Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner. He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.
Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so much like someone I used to... (stopping suddenly) Bruce? I know this is silly, but -- you're not
All street mimes should be executed.
Please tell him... I'm not trying to make his life difficult. I'd just -- I'd just like to know what's going
Oh my God... I've seen this picture.
His face. Allie, look at his face. TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years -- permanently, indelibly traumatized.
Oh, Bruce...
Alexander, you are on drugs.
You're pissing me off, Allie. I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would
Alexander... I
This is pointless. I'm leaving.
Not to me. I need a job.
Then ""everyone"" must know something I don't.
I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?
... Thank you.
And you want a --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
I've seen worse.
(hesitantly) ... Why the mask?
You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you

Look! Police!
Shouldn't we -- A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.
What about her? What about the girl?
Can't we --
... A hundred and eight? He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD, and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.
Well -- I think you might consider thanking
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of
I won't let you have it. THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly. VICKI (cont.) I know you can break my neck and take it. But the Joker's on that same roll. I --
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
... Where are you going to take me? No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand delicately along the line of her cheek... ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS into BATMAN's arms.
... How long have I been out?
(gazing around her) Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. What's that? He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.
I meant to ask you. Up on the roof -- how did you know my name? BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him. VICKI (cont.) I'm serious. How did you know? No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
How'd you find this place?
I don't like bats. Not that kind.
Who pays for all this?
The computers?
No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
Wait. You can just tap into any corporate database you want? Anywhere?
You could've killed him, you know. You could have killed the Joker.
... Bruce? HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Well, Bruce... I don't think... that would be possible.
I, uh...
I just can't --
But he's not.
He's not crazy. KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his chair.
Allie...
He has to tell someone. And I'm the one. He's trying to tell me. KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:
(hesitantly) ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it.
... So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- (frightened) You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
Oh, God. I've got to have some coffee or
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it
""It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make up. I'll need you soon."" --
... Where are you calling from? As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up a telecommunications program. A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
What now!
I'm not frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened
Yeah.
Oh my God.
You okay?
(laughing wildly) God
I loved you too. As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes. The headstone reads: ""ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987.""
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
(grasping for words) I don't, but... I
I guess you did it, didn't you. You saved everyone. (pause) Almost. For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls her over, takes her in a tight embrace.
","What a view. Our little city. It always brings a smile to my face. He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself. JOKER (cont.) Guess it's
'Cause I got an army, chum. And I got
I've considered that possibility.
(chuckling) Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it. THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it. He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's palm. 40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his sleeves and shirt collar. The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room. JOKER (cont.) Looks like Carmine got a little hot under the collar.
That's what they said about Lee Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And
All
How's that first shipment coming?
Mmm. How'd you find it?
... new improved
I know what you're saying. Where can I
Baby's got a tummyache? Here's something that'll fix him
Get dressed. We're going out.
Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds. He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas. He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed. He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's ""THE SCREAM."" JOKER (cont.) I kinda like this one. Leave it.
I think it's safe to take that off. VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes the gas mask, tries to gather her wits. JOKER (cont.) You're quite beautiful.
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it. He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry Lewis-style, as he lights the candles. JOKER (cont.) You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know who
A visual record, yes. A before-and- after kind of thing. (leaning closer) This could
(momentarily puzzled) ...
Strong stomach, huh? I like that in a woman. -- Maybe we can do business after all. He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind them... and a VOICE intrudes:
(to VICKI) Christ, it's my
Shucks, honey, I forgot. (rolling his eyes at
Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask. ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask. JOKER (cont.) You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful. One in a million. A work of
What? I
Miss Vale, was it something I said? (brightly) Do you want to sniff my flower? There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.
Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
... I don't know. We'd better get out of here. (into RADIO MIKE) Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY?? The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately down the street.
Joker here. Can we talk? The MAYOR fumbles for his prepared statement.
Huh.
Ten million dollars. Ten million dollars. (flying off the handle) Ten mi-- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like an ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!! MORE VIDEO STATIC sweeps across the screen, pushing the MAYOR clean out of frame. The JOKER leers at the camera. JOKER (cont.) I might just think up some demands. And I'm gonna talk to all my friends, and see what they want, too. And then maybe we'll get together -- have a little party -- exchange
DAMMIT! You can't get good help these days. -- Let's move out.
Slow down, you
They'll be sorry.
MOVE! Can't you
Oh my God. How does he
Head for the truck!
I
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all... (cackling insanely) You
Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs, I'm here to tell you... we have had one
Look at that, folks. We got 'em
No... NOOOOO!!!
There.
He'll be back... he'll be back!!

Gotham cathedral. Come and get me. HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears, hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.
I'm in the belltower. Don't land.
... Batman? No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS BATMAN up into the belltower. He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- pats his face. JOKER (cont.) Batman? Batman? THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak. JOKER (cont.) I thought you'd be more comfortable here in the belfry. (chuckling to himself) Before I kill you I'd like to see who you are. Would that be okay? BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes and reaches over to undo his cowl. BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face. JOKER (cont.) Oh my, aren't we pretty. (brightening suddenly) I know you! You're the rich boy!! The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps his hands together in sheer glee. JOKER (cont.) My goodness, what in the world made you
Well now, you're not exactly the picture of mental health, are you.
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live. A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his helicopter approaching in the distance. BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins. The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens it gingerly. JOKER (cont.) I have to do it now, Bruce, but it won't even hurt. Now relax. The bat's in his belfry, all's right with the world... He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection. JOKER (cont.) Why,
","Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale. KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:
(to VICKI) You're just back from Corto Maltese. I saw your combat photos. Quite a departure for you.
... You have an extraordinary eye. He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial instincts aroused, pipes up:
I don't... seek publicity. -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
Good. Then with any luck we'll run into each other. Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.
Thank you, Alfred. (to VICKI) I hope you'll excuse me. It was a great pleasure meeting you. (to KNOX) And you. Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and strides hurriedly out of the room.
Too much work. I'm not really the physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred. ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin over braided telephone cables.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. (beat) Tell me, Vicki. There's something I'm very curious about. What took you down to Corto Maltese?
You were one of the most successful magazine photographers in the city. Everyone wanted you.
Not since the shooting started.
What did you see?
There's terror everywhere. Some types are just more --
Insulation? VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.
I think you see things very clearly.
(smiling) Do you assume that if I know you better I won't like you as much? VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.
(taking her hand) Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it. Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's also rather touchingly, almost childishly,
Would you like me to take you home?
Maybe we should just kiss.
I don't sing very well.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free. And I did. -- And here we are.
Vicki. Do you want the whole truth? All coyness aside? (long pause) I wish I had more time to give you. Every day I don't see you, I miss you. (beat) Now. Are you going to waste this lovely afternoon being all mad at me? All this, of course, is delivered with devastating sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.
... Looks like a
Oh my God... are you all right? He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back. He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her face is full of bewilderment and doubt.
Vicki, I've been thinking about you. (long pause) I know it's late. I'm sorry. I -- Are you there?
I'm sorry about the way things went between us. I'd very much like to see you again.
I wish you'd reconsider. (groping) I didn't stand you up today. The museum was closed when I got there.
Don't sell. It won't last. We'll ride it out. With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.
(the familiar rasp) Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
(a little smile) Who's this ""Bruce""? Are you trying to make me jealous?
I've been expecting to hear from you.
What is it you want?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still out there.
There's something I don't understand. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Do you want a drink?
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox. -- I'll have one too.
It wouldn't matter much.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself. -- I'm extraneous to the process.
What it I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one? VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:
(staring right at her) Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save. VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.
Are you expecting anyone? She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door. BRUCE (cont.) Who's there? THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.
Set it down by the door. On the left-hand side. The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, tipless, muttering something about ""cheap shits."" After a moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick up the mysterious package. Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it. As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.
I feel naked without it. He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package. BRUCE (cont.) Not a bomb. But it could be rigged. Wait in the next room. He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife. Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR. In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal. BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the counter.
... They're
(lost in thought) That does it. It's going to be this weekend. The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.
Keep her on the line!
Finding out where she is.
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Got it!
Hang on. I have to leave a message. HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.
There's a garage in this building? VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom. She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak. BRUCE (cont.) I've got to take him out now. He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI. BRUCE (cont.) Pick an apartment and
Oh, hell! The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that something is amiss.
My name is Bruce Wayne. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want. BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on here?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Do you still think the Joker cares about
Sorry. I can't let you leave.
If I let you leave, you'll do the same thing again. You'll go after the Joker... and you'll wind up dead. (turning to go)
I don't care what's in your mind. You're staying. BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL. DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
All this apparatus, Vicki... this house, and the money, and the power... it was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited. (pause) All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see
In all these years... why couldn't I see how it would turn out? He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now she's
Where's the boy?
I know that feeling. It won't last. BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks on tremulously. BRUCE (cont.) He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age. (taking ALFRED's shoulders) I want you to treat him just as if he were me. Promise.
He'll be taken care of financially. Beyond that... you know what to do. Don't let all this go to waste. Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne Manor. On the third step he pauses: BRUCE (cont.) Alfred? -- Thank you. As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.
No... sense... of humor? The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks better of it and retracts his shaking hand. He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his signal beacon. 0:20 and counting. The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down the stairs in a frenzy.
Ohhhh... you don't mean that.
(taking her hand) Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me? A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.
I don't know how to explain this so it makes sense... but
","Great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's the third one this week.
Good answer. I'm gonna put you in for a commendation. KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.
Hiya, gents. This anything I should know about?
No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing
Come on. One question. Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City? KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him: KNOX (cont.) If so, is he on the police payroll? If so, what's he pulling down after taxes?
What have you got for me, Jerry? JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption at the top reads: ""HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"" KNOX nods in approval. KNOX (cont.) Nice, but... maybe a little more gore on the fangs, huh? He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:
I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and dust him, okay?
... Vicki Vale. The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.
Honey -- I would know any randomly selected
God, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Got any more of those?
It's too good, Vick. We got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Small so far. I mean -- they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they.
Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there. KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI may have a purpose in all this. KNOX (cont.) Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying -- She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement. KNOX (cont.) Aw, Vicki. Vicki! (apprehensively) Got a date? She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair. KNOX (cont.) Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always loved you. Will you marry me?
Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
How high up would you say that is?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
The small one. KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later, VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers and hooks up with KNOX. KNOX (cont.) Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually
Yeah, I guess we move in different circles. -- Though I
Commissioner Gordon! What do you hear from our pointy-eared friend? KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.
Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
Mr. Dent. What's
My question is, where does one man get all this
Holy shit... KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.
Likes to kill?
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. (scanning the room) This guy must be the most worthless man in America. Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. (extending a hand) Alexander Knox.
Great. Give me a grant.
""This is Miss Vale."" --
Some people think she has
I know the rich are different, but that guy is
What were you thinking?
Well,
Commissioner. Do us both a favor. Don't tell me some
Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up and asked you for a date?...
Yeah. ""Mister One-Nighter."" (to VICKI) Because that's the average length of his relationships with women.
Tell her about the peanuts.
Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through
Why? (blushing suddenly) Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious. I do this for a living. -- What'd you tell him?
... What was
Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive.
(disgusted) ...Peanut. A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:
Come on. Gimme some
Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd like you to see.
Okay, here we go.
I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Yep. He watched the whole thing happen. -- Recognize the beat cop?
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
He walks out on his own party. Half an hour later, the Caped Crusader turns up in full bat-drag. (beat) Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. No place to
(leaning forward) Oh? Why is that, Vicki? VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for a second, then changes the subject.
... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession to make.
Right. And

The FBI. You know who's got the FBI computer contract? Wayne Technologies. (shaking his head) The guy's bats all right. He's
Not what?
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a

Well, when he does you know my number.
Alexander Knox. Gotham
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you? KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS. Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.
Well, that's how it is, chum. She tells me everything.
Simple. You know the score. One column -- and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets once and for all. (a shaky pause) I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word. BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his jacket for a cigarette. KNOX (cont.) See, I don't know how it happened -- she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but she's in love with you.
Because I -- (beat) Because she'd never speak to me again. KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY. KNOX (cont.) Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What have you got to offer? You gonna marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman? (laughing bitterly) Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be Best Rodent? BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.
Yeah, a drink. ""Civilized."" Man-to- man, right?
What do you say? Let's head for the lights. In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS are sweeping the sky.
So much for Underdog. THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!
Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.
Great.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
(ecstatic) Holy
Jesus, Vicki. That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.

I won't kill you. I want you to do me a favor. NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past. He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own stricken face. BATMAN (cont.) Tell your friends. Tell all your friends. NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually, without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE

Ignition! As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny, synthesized VOICE repeats the command:
I called them.

Too many people. Come on! (as she scrambles out)
How much do you weigh?
... Not even a 'thank you'?
That's because you lied about your weight. (a long pause) Thank you. VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm. BATMAN (cont.) I'll have to ask you for that film.
Please.
The Joker is a murderer. And
All right, here's a compromise. I'll develop the photos. You keep the Jokers and I'll keep the rest.
Because I'll take you with me. He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to him. Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands over a roll of film. The

Quite a while. I took the scenic route.

Stumbled across it when I was a boy. VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers. BATMAN (cont.) They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
They used to terrify me. But I forced myself to keep coming back, and -- (smiling) -- I guess I became the thing I feared the most. I'll do your photos now. He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the roll. VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound. She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is

I'm running a check on the tainted products. There
I've tracked all the records. Every shipment, every warehouse, every loading dock. Nothing. No opportunities for tampering. Somehow the Joker is supplying tainted ingredients... at the source.
Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos are ready. He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.

Are you talking to me? He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing. BATMAN (cont.) Maybe we've had enough for one night. I'll take you home. Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE. BATMAN (cont.) Do you want to do it this time? VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as he walks over to the driver's side and gets in. BATMAN (cont.) Don't be afraid. I'm here. She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP. FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after- burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we
