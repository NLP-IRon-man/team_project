txt,"My guess is we're talking fuel filters here, Fernando. The gas is dirty, these jitneys get in the mountains, their engines cut out.
Easy. Each way.His beeper goes off.
So it finally turned up...Chuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch.
I'll catch the sweep tonight.
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles. And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?There's a muttered chorus of answers.
There's only one way. We have to work together. Every one of us depends on everyone else. If one package is late, we are all late. If one truck misses the deadline, we all miss the deadline. Let's start by taking a look around.Chuck leads his team through the sorting area. Yuri squeezesright next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard.Chuck stops.
Here, this table is too far from the wall. Packages can slip down...like... (pulls out a package from behind a table) ...this.He hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.
What could be in here? Let's say one of you sent it. Could be the closing papers on your dacha, could be a toy for your grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to keep your mother alive. I don't think you want your mother's kidney to end up behind a table.The Sorter shoves the table against the wall. Yuri sayssomething to the Translator.
Kamal? Right. I'm getting them.He pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletinboard as he talks.
I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L. right now. The belts are too small for the sorters. Yeah, sometimes you never see what's right in front of your face. Look, it's --Chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse.Then he notices something over by one of the trucks.
(to a loader) Hold it! Hazardous material needs its own container! (back on the phone) -- three in the afternoon there, right? That gives you five hours until the sweep comes through. Do the sort by hand tonight, then put in a new feeder belt, say a twenty-four incher. Yes, overtime is authorized.He hangs up the phone. He turns to the crew.
I'm going out on every route, I'm going to work every job here, until I know enough to help you. That's it.The crew disperses back to work. Chuck and Aleksei walktoward the office. They've done this before. Chuck lets acorner of his command persona slip.
Worse than Warsaw.
The failures they remember. It's the successes they forget.
You sorted your packages before you left. None of the other drivers did.The Translator and Lev exchange a few words.
So how come the other drivers haven't left yet?The Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy,then snorts an answer. The Translator blushes.
Tell me exactly what he said.
Lev -- it's Lev, right? Listen, this is FedEx. We don't have to accept the way it is.
No, keep trying. A circuit's bound to open up.He hangs up.
(to himself) Those damn Northern Lights.Just then the lights go off. For a moment everything isdarkness. Then a small light switches on. Chuck has aheadlamp on.He gets up, heads into the bathroom. We stay in the bedroom.After only a moment, the light reemerges. It heads over tohis bag. We go with it.Chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper. The guy is preparedfor anything. He goes into the bathroom, closes the door.The lights come back on just as the phone rings.We hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door.Chuck charges out, holding up his pants.Grabs the phone.
Hello? Great. Try it.He waits. We hear an ANSWERING MACHINE.
Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck. I'm going to be a little late. Well, more than a little. I had to go to Russia. Couldn't be helped. Could you call and cancel the trip? Look, we'll sail the Keys in March. It's better then anyway. I'll be back before Christmas. I promise. I think. I mean, I will. I, uh --He's stumbling over whether to say I love you.
I miss you.He gently hangs up the phone.
Only one still left?
(to Aleksei) Give it five minutes.
Let's go.He heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages.All the other executives follow him.
That's Bermuda. Bermuda is in the Memphis thru container. No, Azores is Europe.He gestures at a closed container.
The Paris container. Africa too. Japan goes to Memphis.Chuck is everywhere, setting the example. The whole officeis energized, working together.
Great job, everyone. Remember, work together. We are like a hand...They've heard this before. Lev holds up his hand just beforeChuck does.
You got it.
I absolutely, positively, have to get to Memphis overnight.
Jack -- gotta be something wrong with our physicals, you keep getting certified to fly. Gwen, aren't you worried?
We're on time, right?
Little present from the emerging republics.Another FedEx Road Warrior named STAN gets on. He and Chuckare obviously old hands at this.
What connects the world? What makes it one? (they ignore him) We do. FedEx.
Borrowed. I borrowed it.The two of them strap in.
Great. Terrific. The good guys won one for a change.He's finished a tough job. He's relaxed and on his way home.But Stan's his boss, and Stan's got bad news.
You what?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
Jesus. I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
You fucked us over.
I was making a point.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Baloney. I do see the damn ""big picture.""
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
And never take.
Forget it.
I'm from Arkansas. Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
That's why you're a gambling man.
For the third time.
You are one sick fucker.
This was nothing like Warsaw. I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.But apparently it is.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Talk is cheap. Are we on or not?
Let's go off-line.They both take out their Valium -- the price they pay forbeing such road warriors.
Two Valium...Stan puts on his Walkman.
Damn thing.But for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank it's toolate.Chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off.
Sorry, I'm really sorry.
You seen Kelly Frears?One of them gestures toward a door.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.Surprised, Kelly turns to greet Chuck.
You smell like formaldehyde.Kelly looks over at the Xerox.
Let's take a look.He lifts up the cover.
Cold.
I thought I did.He pries up one feeder, then another.
Got to follow the paper path here.
Used to you could fix these yourself.She pulls him out of the machine. He has toner on hisfingers.
What do you want me to say? That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit? That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
And I can't fix this damn machine.She looks at him.
That's carcinogenic.She ignores that, stays with the fantasy.
On the other hand we could not take a swim...They squiggle themselves onto the desk.
Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was consistently running late by six to ten hours -- sometimes a full day or more. I replaced the station manager. We identified inefficiencies and worked out a quality improvement plan I believe can be met.
Jim's a terrific financial man, no question. But we can't always parachute in from Memphis. We've got to build up our local staff.
We're building a new team here. We got every package on the truck for the first time ever. Success is the best teacher.
Not if you work for FedEx.
Four four. A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
One of those packages just moved.The package turns over, something darts out. It's a puppy,with a bow around its neck.
Hey, look at you.
He is a cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
And for you --Chuck hands over his present.
You know, for when you travel.
I wasn't sending a message. I though you'd like it.Chuck's beeper goes off.
I have to go. I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
You did?She nods. What to do?
Look, I love the puppy. I love you. But I have to go.
I have to.
What should we call him? Or is it her? How about Jango?Kelly is having one of those moments when everything comesclear.
We're a little emotional here. It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
I can't take him to work.He hands her the puppy.
We'll talk about it when I come back. It'll all be fine. Really.This is not a happy woman he is leaving behind.
Kelly? Kelly?No answer, nothing but the sound of Jango, who begins yelpingin the kitchen.
There. There. Easy now.
Kelly?A fire still smolders. The packages have burned. The treeis a blackened mess.Chuck stares at it.
Mom, meet Jango.Chuck displays the puppy.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord. Amen.
Great.
So did I.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Look, I help take care of the place. You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Come on Roger, this is dad all over again. You already did beefalo, chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich? They chased Mom around the yard, sprained her hip.Mom goes to the freezer and takes out some frozenstrawberries.
But chickens?
True enough. No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
Really?
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.Roger grins at him. This is just how they are.
Mom, this is a farm. We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
The place is falling apart.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Come on inside, Mom. You've had a long day.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Terrific. Yours?She nods, used to this.
And get me in to the dentist. My tooth's acting up.Stan enters.
Right. (to Leslie) Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
Kamal? Kamal? Can you hear us?The box squawks. The TV screen rolls an imperfect image.
Kamal, you're breaking up. Can you hear us?
Who is this? Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?The squawk box hums and crackles. Nothing. Chuck turns tothe Technician.
When's the next Jumbo?
Anything else?
Call Operations. Get me on it.And Stan is impressed.
It's our dog. It belongs to us.
Yes there is.Kelly can't stay mad.
No, it was great. Maybe a little overkill --
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Malaysia. They're holding the sweep.She stares at him for a long moment, then at the puppy.
A week, max. Okay? Okay?
Al -- gotta be something wrong with our physicals, you keep getting certified to fly. John, aren't you worried?
You're on your way home, Al?Al has an Australian accent.
We're on time, right?
All right, guys. I'm here. Check the GPS, get moving.
Where the fuck are you?But now he is really thirsty. We WALK with Chuck up thebeach.Beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts. He picks oneof them up and studies it. It's heavy, almost the size of avolleyball. How to get in it?He throws it down on a rock. The coconut just bounces off.He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rockdown on it. It bounces off. He throws down a bigger rock.It smashes on the rocks and chips. Chuck picks up the rock.OW! Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp. It cutshim.
Sonofabitch.The blood stains the rock a bright red. Chuck sucks on hisfinger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive manfirst got when he discovered stone tools.He picks up the rock, test the edge. Sharp -- really sharp.He throws another rock down, but it doesn't break. He picksup another rock and strikes the first one. Then again,harder. And again. A large flake shoots off. This edge iseven sharper.He has a knife.
That was smart, really smart.Rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving hisfingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again. The shellsplits! The precious liquid splashes out. Left inside is aswallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly. The milky whiteliquid dribbles down his face.
Ahhh.
Maybe the GPS malfunctioned. That Korean airliner did.Clouds scud in front of the sun. Beyond the reef the wavesare high and churning. Chuck can see them pound onto thereef.
Okay, do the math. Maybe they know where you are within, say 500 miles. That's a circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared. So, uh, 250,000 times three point one four, that's about 800,000 square miles. Three times the size of Texas.This sinks in. Then Chuck gets an idea.
They could use a satellite.But even that doesn't give him much hope.
Say each satellite photo is 30 feet square, that's uh...fuck it...billions and billions of photos.That sinks in.
Aw, someone will come.
What the hell?
Oh Jesus.
I'm so sorry, Al. So sorry.
Got to cover Al up.He wants to say more, can't. He scoops some sand over thebody.
Got to cover Al up.He scoops in some more sand. It's eerily like burying thetropical fish in his back yard.
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine...He looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point.Comes to a decision. He takes a drink of coconut, picks uphis club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants.He's ready to go.
Yellow submarine. We all live in a yellow submarine...
Bad idea. Should have saved some.He throws away the husk. He looks up, but the only sunlightreaching him is dappled from the canopy above him.
Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?Hugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with greatcaution, he sets out across the bridge.
Shit!He looks back, but that seems even scarier.
Got to get there. Got to see. C'mon... c'mon. Don't be such a wuss. Be bold.He looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, andjumps. It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when helands on the other side. He hugs the rocks, getting hisbreath.
No way on. No way off.Chuck stares out to sea in every direction. Nothing.
This is bad. Really, really bad.The last rays of sun hit his face. The ocean turns a deepreddish gold.
Come on. Crawl if you have to.Chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.
Got to drink. Got to drink something.With his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick. Hebangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk. He staresat the stack of FedEx boxes. What could be inside? Hereaches out and touches one.
They don't belong to you.Responsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes hishand away.
Got to have shade. Got to have a hat.He ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets itupon his head. It looks amazingly like some sort ofprimitive cap.He grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach.
Oh, God. Thank you.
You deserve a break today...He is desperately thirsty. Hunger gnaws at him.
Damn fish!On some rocks he sees clusters of limpets. He takes a rockand tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.
Wait a minute. Wait just a minute.He picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card.
Don't leave home without it.With his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat,then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slideoff the shell into his mouth.
Yuck.He starts to spit it out. Tries to make himself like it.
Yumm.And he swallow it.
Got to get this fixed.But what's the point? Everything that was so valuable beforeis useless now.
Water, water, everywhere, water, water everywhere...Covered in sweat, desperate and exhausted, he throws down hiswooden spade.
Where's the water on this fucking island?He lies on his back, breathing hard. Pulls his hat over hiseyes.
Just rest a minute.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Let's see, I waited two days. (makes marks) Then I buried Al. (slowly makes another mark) Al. You never made it home, buddy. Then American Express got me those clam things... (makes another mark) I dug all those damn holes, the clouds over the moon... (makes more marks) And today, the historic discovery of H, Two, Oh. (makes a tenth mark and underlines it) Ten days. Shit.For a moment, he feels the weight of his isolation. Then heallows himself a deep breath. There is order now, after all.Time is under control.
A crab, it's a crab.He freezes, holding his spear motionless. Then he jabs atthe crab -- misses! The crab scurries away toward the rocks.
Dammit!Chuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling,getting up, stabbing again.Suddenly one stab feels different. Chuck carefully lifts upthe spear. On the end is a squirming crab.
I did it. I did it!He walks carefully with it to the beach. Lowering the spear,he lets the crab slip off. It darts toward the water. Chuckheads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws.He kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down onit. He twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky whitemeat. But a crab has an exoskeleton. The flesh simply poursout, like mucous.
Jesus.This is too much. He needs the next step, from the raw tothe cooked. The crucial next step from primitive man to thebeginnings of civilization.
Stupid fucking thing!He quits, exhausted. He looks at his hands. They are rawand blistered. He feels like Job.
I don't know what I did, God, but whatever is was, I am really, really sorry. You hear me? Really sorry.
Don't have a choice, do I?He walks over and picks a few boxes up from the P.
Okay. Okay now.
You're not getting it hot enough. Got to hold the heat. Got to hold the heat.
Sonofabitch!He starts to rub again. He breathes hard, sweat pours offhis face. He is really going for it, what the hell! A tinywisp of smoke appears! Chuck saws with even more energy.
Come on. Come on.The smoke increases. Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs thenest of shavings, and blows on it frantically. The smokeflickers and dies. Chuck can't believe it.
No. No. No.
That's the big dipper...Orion...or is that the Southern Cross...? Kelly would know.And he misses her so much. A shower of meteors streaksacross the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down onChuck.
Dammit!He replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.
Careful now, careful...He gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, thenblows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding lifeitself. He shreds his money and business cards over the tinyflame.Suddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of thekindling. Desperate, Chuck grabs it. Trying to shield itwith his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them intothe sand, trying to make a windbreak. They rustle and shakeand blow over.The wind blows harder. Chuck jams some rocks in a circle tomake an eddy. But the fire is out. No words now, just aloud, primal groan of pure despair.And then, into his vision floats...smoke.Chuck looks down. A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest oftinder! Chuck blows on it gently. Suddenly a tiny tongue offlame flickers and catches on the kindling!
Yes! Yes! Yes!He feeds in some more twigs, more tinder. The flames lickout, catch, grow.
If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I am sure I did, thank you now.
Damn tooth!He fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills.
Beautiful. So beautiful.Chuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and hecan see them no more. It's late now.Leaving, he takes one last look, as he always does. Andanother remarkable sight greets his eyes. There, on thehorizon, just below the evening star, is a...LIGHT. Hestares at it, fixed.
A star. It's a star.But then he stares at it really hard.
It's a ship.
Timberrr!...then slowly falls with a CRASH!
I heard that...Chuck holds his surgeon's saw over the stump. He walks toanother tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.
No more waiting. Take action.Chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle andsuturing thread for a sail.
That's right. Take action.He cuts bamboo for the mast. He carves driftwood for an oar.He fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut ashe sings ""Fly Me to the Moon"" to himself.He ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bambooboom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape. He ties onthe doctor's kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings.He examines his handiwork: a finished raft.He brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, thengrabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to thebeach. It doesn't budge. He tries to pull it again.Nothing. He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs.Nothing. He collapses on the beach, his breath coming inheaves.
How could I be so stupid?He bangs himself on the head, over and over.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
You're too low in the water. Too damn low.Chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deepsobs of despair.And then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deepinside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain. TheScream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island,the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves.It is powerful, disturbing, primal.The breeze picks up. Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin tosway. The tide is reaching up toward the beach. The wavescrash louder. The palm trees sway even more.Chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.
Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure -- and unto dust shalt thou return.A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck andsizzling in the fire.Chuck looks up: clouds have obscured the sun. The windblows harder. The rain falls harder, streaking the sandChuck had rubbed on his body. STEAM sizzles out of the fire.Chuck looks up, disbelieving. The bottom falls out of theheavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seenbefore. A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reachingfor the fire.Forget the raft! Forget despair! The fire could go out!This is disaster!
Shit!He springs into action. Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box.With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS outof the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them. He slidesthe coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwoodand sets off on a run.
Please...please...please...He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife. Heplaces this kindling on the coals. They sputter and sizzle.Barely catch. He fans them with the box. A tiny flickercatches, then starts to grow.
Firewood. I need firewood.
What the fuck are you doing?His deepest instinct was to survive. And that is what he isgoing to do.
Hang on. Just hang on.Slowly he pulls himself back from the edge.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Whoo, pig. Sooey!He falls back in the water and floats there, looking up atthe sky.
No pain, no gain.He brings the hammer down hard on the chisel! The screengoes BLACK as Chuck's SCREAM continues UNDER.
Chips? Dip?But Wilson declines.
No?He takes a big crunchy bite.
Another fucking day in paradise.PULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into thebowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip.
Help me, Wilson...He collapses again.
Throws down the spear and waves his arms.
No! Wait! Come back!He runs into the water and starts to swim. He is so weak,however, he can only make a few strokes. He tries to yell ashe swims...
Wait! Wait!Choking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on thebeach. In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance.
You old airhead, you need a makeover.He takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows onthe ball. Then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers inthe juice, and makes lips. He sticks shells on with clay foreyes. Then he looks at the face.
Wilson, you bad!He sits back and regards his companion. He gestures aroundthe cave at the new paintings.
What do you think?But Wilson doesn't have an opinion.
You don't share much, do you?Idly Chuck takes down the Angel Box.
I guess I know how Kelly felt.For a long time he studies the wings on it. With a stick, hetries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave.Dissatisfied, he wipes it away. He looks at the Angel Box.Casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife.Inside he finds two bottles of green salsa. And a letter.He reads over it.
You said our life was a prison. Dull. Boring. Empty. I can't begin to tell you how much that hurt. I don't want to lose you. I'm enclosing some salsa, the verde you like. Use it on your sticky rice and think of home. Then come home -- to me. We'll find the spice in our lives again. Together. I love you. Always. Bettina.Visibly moved, Chuck puts down the letter.
He never got it.
She's probably found someone else. I would have.Chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors andstreaks it slowly across his face. To exorcise hisloneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas thereis: his own body.
Hello.
What the hell are you waiting for?
Canteens. Sea anchor. Got to weave rope. Spears. A sail.
Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight I'll get condensation down here, a cup or so a day. If I'm careful it should be enough.
If I never return, know that here lived Chuck Noland for four years. I drew these paintings. I made these marks. And then I took my fate in my own hands and set forth to save myself, God willing.
Wilson, my main man. Time to go.And he gently leads the raft into the lagoon.
Wonder what odds Stan would give me on this. I'd say 90-10. Against.He jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where thesurf crashes onto the reef.
Wilson, we're out of here.He turns and begins raising the sail.
Slow down, damn you!Exhausted, he sinks back to the raft. Two Dorados leap intothe air ahead of him.Chuck tries to stare again into the water. He spots anotherfish, a flash of silver under the surface.Chuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear. SPLAT!Something strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him intothe water.On the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue. AFLYING FISH. Chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.
Catch it catch it catch it --He catches it again just as it almost flops over the side.
I'm an angel.Suddenly he sees other lights. A ship. A ship is out there.And he hears it, a humming in deep register.He waves his hands. He yells.
Here! Here!His voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean.The lights move on.
No...no...no...His raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard. Chuck is throwninto the water!He comes to the surface, sputtering. Where is the raft?He looks one way, then another. Darkness.This is the worst.He turns again in the water. There, dimly, he can see theglow from the fish he killed. The glow saves his life.He swims toward it.He pulls himself back on the raft.He lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescencecasting a greenish light on his face.
Sea anchor! Let out the sea anchor!Frantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds downa huge wave. The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that itrides the wave down.The waves come at him high as houses. The raft rides up oneside, then plunges down the next.All Chuck can do is hold on.
Stop!He takes his oar and begins beating the water. The killingcontinues.
You fucking murderers!Suddenly the water is still. One dolphin sticks its head outof the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking.Another dolphin lifts its head up, then another. They squeakto each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck.
I know you're talking about me!He splashes the water with his oar.They dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.
(very softly) Take me with you.They're gone.
Why me? Why me, God?He begins to laugh.
Oh, shiiiittt!Then comes the wake of the ship. It rocks the raft like apiece of flotsam. The raft rides high up on the wave, thenshoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slowsand rides along with the wave.And then the sea is calm again.Slowly Chuck sinks to his knees. His hand lets loose hispants.He lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation withthe ship's captain.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
May I ask, where are you bound?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
No please, join me. Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.The depression comes back again.
Chuck Noland. Born October 8, 1958. Died -- pick a date -- July 11, 1998. And now the epitaph. Met deadlines. Kept appointments. Lost without a trace.He sits back, looks at the mock headstone.
I am writing this to remind myself to live a better life. If I am lost, perhaps you who find this will be instructed to live a better live yourself. Live each day. Love your children. Don't take anyone for granted.
Please, no sharks.Then he dives in to the water! Swims frantically afterWilson.Wilson floats away from him. He swims, but he's so weak.Finally he gets to Wilson. He reaches out, but only pushesthe ball farther away.It bobs on the waves. Chuck treads water, exhausted.Where is the raft?
Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.Then he turns back the other way. The raft has drifted byhim. He can go after Wilson, or he can go after the raft.
Shit! Wilson!He swims toward the raft, barely moving. No matter how hardhe swims, the raft seems to recede from him.Finally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard,choking, crying.He struggles to pull himself on board.But he is weak, so weak. He can't do it.Summoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again.This time he slides on.He lies on the raft, panting.Then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet,holds on to the mast, scans the ocean for Wilson.
Wilson!Nothing but waves.This is too much. Chuck starts to cry.
Thank you. Oh thank you.Deliriously happy. Delirious.
My favorite doctor. What's the verdict?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
All I ate was fish. That's solid protein.
Which I didn't have.
I am one lucky guy.
But all that's behind me. I'm fine now.He starts to laugh again.
I most definitely say I am.
Yes, yes he did.
Not to mention on me.The laughter again. Unsettling.
Doc, I'm not on the island. I'm not on the raft. I'm alive. I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you. I just want out of here.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...The laughter again.
Two Valium and the Rolling Stones. That ring a bell?There's a long silence. Then we hear Stan's voice.
It's me.
I'm most definitely not dead. And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.Chuck begins to laugh, a little too loud, a little tooshrill. He's on a high.
I beat the odds!
This is Amber. Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.He says this with an absolute straight face, holding back thelaughter with great effort. Instantly there's thisconnection again between him and Stan.
Hey...hey...it's okay!Chuck is happy, he's still riding the high.
No...no...feels good...She disengages, looks at him with that old smile.
A few things came up. Or went down.He meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile.
You look...wonderful. I like your hair.He notices the ring on her hand.
I thought you might have.
I know.
I would have done the same thing.His responses come so quick. Chuck seems blissfully sure ofhimself.
You have any children?Kelly nods.
Got a picture?Kelly fishes for a photo, shows it to Chuck. It's a littlegirl with a dog.
Is that Jango?
Life's just one big joke after another.Stan appears, takes in the scene. The few patients waitingare edged into the corners, trying to look occupied withsomething else.
Want to see my raft?
You should have smelled me.Stan examines the ropes around the logs.
I braided them.
Time I had lots of.Kelly points at something on the raft.
That's my sea anchor. My second one. Made it out of part of the sail. It keeps you from capsizing in a storm. In theory. (picks up his still) And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.He's not feeling sorry for himself. It's just a fact.
Forty-three days.They look at the tiny raft. It speaks for itself.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.Kelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it.
My epitaph.Kelly reads it to herself. Her eyes are moist.
Bad body chemistry. Made me a little morbid. But I'm all over that now.And he seems really to believe it.
There was a coffin?
What was inside?
That about sums it up.
The plane went down. My friends died. I washed up on an island. Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
The tide came in, the tide went out. I survived. That's the headline. I survived.
Cliches, mainly. Don't take anyone for granted. Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
Not when you have no choice.Kelly looks down at the raft. It's so small.
I didn't know what really being alone was. No one back here does.He has something more to say. She waits.
We're not meant to be alone. Not like that. Share life, that's what came to me out there. Be with someone.And that's the point, isn't it? We are social animals. Noman is an island.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.And the laughter comes again. Kelly grins, embarrassed, alittle worried.
Great. Really.She stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, thistime with great tenderness.He nods, her touch feels so good.A wave of emotion comes over her: pity? love?
I don't know. I really don't know.We hear a distant beep-beep, discrete as a car horn can be.
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
You too.Then she heads for the waiting car. Chuck stands by hisraft, watching her go.
I never thought it would end. Then it did. It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.Stan pulls a flask out of his bag.
For years my only drinking buddy was a soccer ball. Wilson.Stan hoists his glass.
To Wilson.Now's when Stan gets to the question he's been wanting toask, that Kelly wanted to know, that we all want to know.
Hallelujah.Stan looks over at him.
What's it all about? It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.Stan sits back, repulsed but relieved.
To life.
Believe me I know.He takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking.
But it's not being bold or being in the game or rolling the dice.All those things Stan used to tell him.
When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd argue with myself about everything. Because everything had a price. To get anything -- a sip of water, a little corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had to let go of something else. And then I could never get it back.He thinks some more.
You don't win or lose. You win and lose.He looks out the window.
You win and lose.And Chuck has. Big time.
Where's Mom?
Tell me about it.Stan nudges Chuck. Time to go to the podium.
Wow. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Hey, Rasheed, how you doing? Thank you all.
Thank you. Thank you very much...Everyone applauds.
Give me a minute. I've spent four years looking out at an empty ocean.He laughs, a short brittle laugh, composes himself.
It's all so -- big. You never think you'll miss -- all this. But I did. I really, really did. And I missed all of you.He looks over at the hub.
You've added some new belts, and what's that?He points at some high tech equipment on the edge of theshed.
Digital laser readers. Wow. Terrific.He looks around at everyone, doesn't know what else to say.
I've never heard it this quiet. Shouldn't you all be getting back to work?The tension is broken. Everyone laughs. Phil Steele motionswith his hand. Let it be done.
Take your time.
That's what it's about.
Not just that. Take your time. Use it. Live it.
Deliver this package. Then, I dunno.
I need to do it.
You want to help, help me find the woman who sent this.
What about the sender?
Can you find her?
Thanks. For everything.
Check, please.The waitress comes over.
When'd you start working here?
I wanted to come here.
That was great, Mom, just great.He looks around the house, everything in its place. Hismother has been here for forty years. There's a big crackrunning down from the ceiling.
I've got all this back pay coming. Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Miss that island? Mom, come on.She looks at him. She knows her boy.
The tide saved me, Mom. I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.She looks at him, thinks about this.
FedEx for Bettina Peterson.The woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasn't seenin years and never expected to see again.
Charles Noland. FedEx Special Projects.Bettina notices Chuck's bicycle.
There was an unavoidable delay.Bettina stares at the package, her own memories coming back.
No.She holds the box and studies him for a long moment.Something -- the look on his face, the extraordinaryreappearance of this long-lost package -- makes her curious.
As much as anybody.
Okay. Sure.She lets Chuck in the door.
(takes a sip) It's good.They smile awkwardly at each other. She starts to open it.
Possible. So you did those wings?
They're harder to do than they look.
Well, I do a little drawing --She's opened the package. She pulls out the bottles of salsaand the letter.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
Well, not really, I --
To tell you the truth -- you did.
No. that was the last one.
Hey.
That was my last one.Bettina hands Chuck a sheet of paper.
Sure.
Need some help?
No.Where is he from, anyway?
I used to drive one of those. A long time ago.
Sure.He picks up his bike.
Yeah.
Well --
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.Erica laughs.
Yeah, completely.She looks over at him with a grin.
Had a package to deliver.
I had it on the island with me.
","Sonofabitch!
Chuck! You're back!She leaps into his arms.
Your eyes are puffy. Did you take Valium again?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
How was Russia?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that. Did you get it fixed?
Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well?But Chuck doesn't want to talk. He's focused on the machine.
Chuck.
Yeah, tell me. Tell me all of it.He suddenly looks really tired.
You don't even know what time it is. What day it is.He turns to the Xerox in frustration.
Come on.
We're on the deck of the ketch, the air's soft, the water's clear as crystal...She licks the last bit of toner off his fingers.
We're covered with suntan lotion and sweat. Our skin is so hot, it's glowing...And she comes closer to him.
We could take a swim.She's really close now.
Merry Christmas eve.
You break four million packages last night?In the b.g. one of the packages by the Christmas tree isstarting to shake on its own.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?Chuck's attention goes to the tree.
Merry Christmas.Chuck bends down to see the puppy.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --A baby, she wants to say, but that's going a little fast soshe catches herself. Chuck picks the puppy up.
He's your cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
So do good things come in large packages?Kelly opens Chuck's present -- a very large box.It's a piece of luggage.
For when I travel?She can't believe it. It's the exact opposite of what shewanted.
You should have got me something that shows you want us to be together, not apart.Chuck is flummoxed. Women read so much into things.
You should have got me a ring.He checks the number.
A ring. I wanted a ring.
You can't go now.
You want to.Chuck picks up the puppy.
This isn't working out.
""We're"" not over-reacting.
No.
That's your dog.
There isn't any us.
I'm sorry about the presents. I got a little carried away.
I burned the Christmas tree.She's half-laughing, half-wanting-to-cry.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad? Don't tell me you're mad. Be mad. Be who you are right now.
Don't even start.And then it hits her.
Get back? From where?
Give him to me.He hands her the dog.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
Go on. We'll be fine. I'll feed Jango to the frogs.She kisses the puppy.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
You're so thin. Am I hurting you?Well, maybe a little, but who cares? He hasn't been huggedor barely touched in so long.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
I would never --
If I'd known you were alive --
I didn't want to. It just happened. One day Gary was there. He took care of everything. He took care of me. I was a mess.
Her name's Hannah.
No, this is Jack. Jango was hit by a UPS truck. Can you believe it?Chuck laughs. It is funny, sort of.
What's that?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that, written on the sail?
I buried you, Chuck. They had to pry my fingers off your coffin.This interests Chuck to no end.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Yeah?
Don't overwhelm me with the details. (she smiles remembering) You know how I hate that.He tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how.
(gently) Come on. Try.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
You hated being alone. Couldn't stand it. Busy every minute. Always plugged into something.
This is so unfair.
You okay?
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I had to come. To be sure you were okay.They hold each other. For a long time.
I love you, Chuck.
I'm so glad you're alive.Chuck grins.
","What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
How'd it go?
I had to bump your plane last night.Chuck can't believe it.
It was fifteen minutes late.The plane begins to taxi.
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
What? Let Paris hold its plane? Let Memphis take care of it? Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
You know what your problem is? You just see the packages in front of you. You don't see the big picture.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
For all those vacation days you got coming.Chuck doesn't look up.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane. But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right. Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while? So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys. We've got to be bold. You always want all your ducks lined up. But nothing's 100 percent. It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60. Then roll the dice.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not. That's why you're not married and I am.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow. That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.Stan is so outrageous, Chuck can't help but laugh.
I'm trying to help you here. There's Warsaw, there's this --
Look, that kids' bike, that's a guy who'll do what it takes to get there on time. Live up to your legend, that's all I'm saying.Chuck reaches in his pocket, pulls out a bill.
Ninety five percent? Just give me the money now.
We're on.Chuck closes the PowerBook.
And the Stones. Got to be.It's their ritual. Chuck puts headphones from his Walkmanover his ears, puts a mask over his eyes and leans his headback onto the headrest. We hear the Rolling Stones.
Chuck. Wake up Chuck.Chuck pulls off the mask, takes out the earplugs. He managesa groggy grin.
You gotta do your own delivery from here.
We're already on it.
He's a numbers cruncher. Chuck's done all the right things here...Stan is doing his best to back up Chuck.
Malaysia's tanking. We're meeting in ten in operations.
We got Telex, e-mail?
Maybe you should get your ducks lined up first.Chuck looks over at Stan.
Chuck! God damn!Chuck struggles out of the chair.
God damn. God damn. God damn.They are both almost overcome. Stan holds Chuck by theshoulders and looks at him.
You're alive, you're fucking alive!Chuck laughs, thrilled to see Stan.
You beat 'em to shit, pal! Jesus!
Hello.
Really.And he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse oftheir shared unspoken irony.
Uh, there's somebody out here who wants to see you.Chuck stares sharply at him. Kelly? Stan nods, but there'ssomething he wants to say.
She thought you were dead. We all did.That's not all Stan wants to say. But Chuck is limping outthe door.
How about we go somewhere else?
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
You were how long on this?
I'll be at the car. (to Kelly) Take you to the airport.And he leaves.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You need a drink.Stan takes two glasses from his bag, rests them on a FedExcontainer, and pours the whiskey.
To Wilson.
So, what's it all about?Chuck stares at him.
You've been over the line and you came back. You've been saved, hallelujah!
I'm serious. The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
Do what it takes. That's what I always told you.He pours another drink.
To life. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
That's all there is.
Smile.Chuck smiles.
Wave.And Chuck waves. He's overwhelmed by all the input. Stansteers Chuck down the steps as the cheers continue.At the bottom of the steps Roger steps forward. The twobrothers embrace each other. After a moment Rogerdisengages. Mary gives Chuck a hug.
Digital laser readers.
What?
Being patient. Don't rush things. I get it.He swerves into another lane.
Deep, real deep.He grins, cuts across to the exit.
So where to? The office? The hotel? The beach?Chuck stares at him. Are you kidding?
What, then?
(re: the package) You want that delivered, we'll deliver it. That's what we do.
Finish what you started. You haven't changed, Chuck. It's still you.Right.
I do.He holds out a badge.
No sweat.
","Trying.
Sure. Just not getting any answers.Chuck turns to Leslie.
You sure you don't want to have the implant done here? We do quite good work.Chuck shakes his head: no. She scrapes behind his frontteeth.
Hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter behind these front incisors. A little wider, please.Chuck opens his mouth even further. The technician talks onin the self-absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do,that constant babble of human contact which Chuck has notheard for four years.
Anyway, so the second prosthetic foot worked better, but he still couldn't drive his new Cortina, it being a standard shift, if you follow me.Chuck nods. I follow you.
But would he hear of me driving him around? Not on your bloody life. Rinse please.Chuck does. Stan bursts into the room.
I still need to floss you.Stan notices the technician.
Ex-boyfriend.
Okay. After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC. Here it is. (gestures at computer map) Ten packages from the same sender. Baku. Delhi. St. Petersburg. The guy was a real road warrior. This package was Kuala Lampur. No activity in his account after this package. No forwarding addresses after K.L.
Sure. Bettina Peterson. Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.He works some keys, waits.
Hmmm. Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization. I don't have it.
Okay, let's let it rip.He starts to pull up the data.
","Save some for tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying. Solution, fix rope.
Get up.
Get up, damn you.Chuck comes to his knees. Then sinks back down.
You've had today's water.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Do too little you'll die.
Okay, look have an extra swallow.He holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons ofmurky water.
Take it.
Take it, damn it.
Wilson, do you believe this? Take the damn water.Slowly Chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes aswallow. Then another.
Stop. Enough.Then another.
Think. Got to use something else.He gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.
Survive today, that's the point.The kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used totie the logs, but it's all he has. He ties the log with thekite rope. Exhausted, he lies back down.
Polaris, where are you? Maybe I'm too far south.
Moon's too bright.We hear the fraying sound again.
I'm putting it off.He looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.
Fix raft first.
You like that?Very slowly it drifts along with the raft.
Lost your mate?We look right into the whale's eye. Beneath the surface wecan see the huge jaws open and close.
You're beautiful. Marry me.
No, don't go. Look, I've got fish.Chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front ofthe whale, which ignores it.
Please don't dive. Please.The whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge backand heads straight for the bottom.For a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black andvertical against the dark blue sky. With one swoop, thoseflukes could destroy Chuck and his raft. But they don't doanything except slowly sink.Then it is gone.We are on Chuck's face as he stares at where the whale hadbeen, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripplesthat reach out and gently rock the raft.
Can't kill another one. Can't. Can't kill my friends anymore.
Why do they have to die for me?
Got to eat.Chuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses.Suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear. Itstruggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on itshead, twists the stone knife into its spine. The strugglingstops.Chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.
I am so sorry.He cries uncontrollably. As he cries he cuts off the head,pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one. Then he sucks themarrow out of the head.Then takes the heart and eats that. Then eats the liver.As he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips.When he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and suckson it.Fish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.
Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean roll.He closes his eyes. After a minute they come open.
I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date.They slowly close again.
No!His eyes come open again.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
But I have promises to keep. (rolls over) And miles to go before I sleep. (props himself up) And miles to go before I sleep. (purpose now) Got to fix the sea anchor. Use the sail.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Grow up, stop being such a baby. Other people get through a lot worse.
What? Are you sacrificing yourself for me?Carefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear intothe fish.Flapping and struggling, it lands on the deck. Chuck pounceson it.
Damn it! I had to do it!The banging continues.
I'm sorry!He concentrates on his work, then sits back on his heels inamazement. There's another fish inside. He holds that fishup, stares at it, then cuts it open.There's a smaller fish inside it.
I know there's a moral here, God, but right now I'm just going to eat.He pops out an eyeball, then another, and crunches thembetween his teeth.He takes the heart and liver, starts to eat, then stops.
Forgot to say grace. Sorry Mom.He struggles to remember.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and Christ and the bounty about to receive, or something...amen.He eats them.
Please don't leak. Please.Chuck picks up the smallest fish. It's half digested. Hewashes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble athis fingers.
Don't look at me. It was that Dorado.He cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you. Thank you God.
Not again.Fins cut the water. SHARKS. A big hammerhead bumps theraft. BadChuck hums the theme from ""Jaws."" Chuck takes hisspear stabs at the shark.
Get away from me!The shark circles again, that big hammerhead like anightmare.
Get him get him get him.He stabs at it with his spear. He might as well have stabbedconcrete. The shark circle, Chuck stabs again.But the shark is gone.
Where are you? Where are you?Stabs again and again at the empty ocean.
Stop! You're using energy. Move slowly. Be patient.Chuck kneels, wavering, on the raft. The ocean is calm.Suddenly, BUMP. The raft tilts.Chuck hangs on.Then a shark appears, just out of spear range. Its lifelessblack eyes seem to stare right through Chuck.If the Dorado was a gift from God, this is a message fromHell.Then the shark is gone.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel. With Kelly.He smiles at the thought.
The music ends. We go back to the table. The waiters have brought dinner. New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce. Mushrooms in brown gravy. Roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary. Green Beans with almonds. Fresh biscuits and cornbread, dripping with butter. A nice salad with ranch dressing. A jumbo shrimp cocktail.Thinks about that, it spoils the picture.
No shrimp. (then) We eat.He closes his eyes. This is the greatest fantasy.
(as the waiter) For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode, we have a double chocolate cake with creme anglaise, we have a nice pear torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if you care to wait a few minutes, a grand marnier souffle?Chuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.
Why, bring them all, bring them all.He rolls over. There, square in his vision, is a ship, itsform coming in and out of a low haze.Chuck jumps to his feet. Waves. Screams.
Here! Over here!The ship moves on. We can see the decks the rigging, thevastness of it.Chuck realizes he is naked. Struggles to pull on the remainsof his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one handas he continues to wave.On the ship no one is to be seen. It is a spooky sight.The big tanker moves on.We are on Chuck's face. Passed up again.Then he realizes what is about to happen. He throws out thesea anchor.He throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as hecan, wiggles his feet into the ropes.
They're on autopilot.
Damn it! Don't be so negative!Chuck picks up Wilson.
Wilson, what's your story?He holds Wilson close to his chest.
I'm serious. I'm always going on about me, me, me. Enough about me. Your turn.
Shut up.He lies on the raft and holds Wilson close.We move up until we see --
Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't be lazy. We're okay today. We're okay today.And the other Chuck begins to laugh.
Shut up.The laughter goes on.
Shut the fuck up! I mean it.He stands up and checks the horizon.
What's so damn funny?
Jesus.
It's real.
Let's get a second opinion. Wilson? What do you see?Chuck picks up the soccer ball, holds it up, and stares outat...ocean.
It matters. We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Shut up. I don't feel like dying today.
