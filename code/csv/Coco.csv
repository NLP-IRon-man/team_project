txt,"Holá, Mamá Coco.
I used to run like this... Miguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists. Then he switches to flat palms.
But now I run like this which is way faster!
And the winner is... Luchadora Coco! Miguel leaps off the bed onto a pile of pillows that bursts, sending feathers onto Mamá Coco who wears a mask of her own.
I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side. Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple--
No, gracias.
S-sí?
Love you, Mamá! Once outside, Miguel makes his way through the small town of
Hola! He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes, the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.
Muchas gracias!
Hey, hey! Dante! Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head.
Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake. Fist bump. Dante obeys to the best of his ability.
Good boy, Dante! Miguel tosses the pan dulce to his furless friend who topples back into the trash can.
...If it wasn't for my family.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, sorry. He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe. As Miguel shines, the mariachi plucks his guitar idly.
I just can't really talk about any of this at home so...
I could never say that...
I don't know. I mean... I only really play for myself--
Uh-uh, my family would freak!
...Seize your moment? The mariachi appraises Miguel, then offers his guitar.
Abuelita!
Um...uh... Miguel quickly packs away his shine rag and polishes. Abuelita barrels up to the mariachi. She hits his hat with her shoe and waves him away.
He was just showing me his guitar... Gasps from the family.
Yes, Tío Berto. Dante ambles up to Miguel, sniffing and whining for a treat.
No, no, no! Abuelita shoos him away.
It's just Dante... Abuelita throws her shoe at the dog.
I was just shining shoes!
But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is.
(blurting) But what about tonight?
Well they're having this talent show- Abuelita perks her ear, suspicious. Miguel squirms, deciding whether to go on.
And I thought I might... Mamá looks at Miguel, curious.
Well, maybe?
I thought we were done...
Like Mamá Coco's papá?
But you're the one who--
I was just--
But--
Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon, Dante. Hurry up. Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy. Someone could hear me! Miguel reveals a makeshift guitar, cobbled together from a beat up old soundboard and random other items. He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears to be his own version of a skull guitar head.
I wish someone wanted to hear me... Miguel tunes the guitar.
Other than you... Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick. Miguel gives a grossed- out chuckle. He lifts his guitar and strums.
Perfecto! He crawls to the far side of the attic where he's built his own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz. Posters, candles, and songbooks are arranged with care. Miguel lights the candles with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz holding his skull guitar. Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover. Then he imitates de la Cruz's pose and smile. He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the VCR, ""Best of de la Cruz"" scrawled on the spine. A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruz's films plays out. A clip from ""A QUIEN YO AMO:""
...and make it come true. The tape ends. The words sink into Miguel. He reaches for the flyer for the plaza ""TALENT SHOW.""
No more hiding, Dante. I gotta seize my moment! Dante wags his tail, panting happily.
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me!
Get under, get under!
Nothing! His Abuelita and parents stare straight at him. A pit grows in his stomach; he's been caught.
Mamá -- Papá, I-- Papá lifts his finger to silence his son.
What?!
But what if I'm no good at making shoes?
...A shoemaker. Through and through. Papá swells.
Dante! No, Dante, stop! Miguel pulls the dog away from the ofrenda, but the table shakes. The frame with Mamá Imelda's photo sways back and forth, then topples to the ground with a sickening crack.
No, no, no, no, no! No... Miguel picks up the old photo of Mamá Imelda, which unfolds to reveal another portion, hidden all these years;
De la Cruz's guitar...?
Mamá Coco, is your papá... Ernesto de la Cruz?
Ha, ha!
Papá! Papá! His parents stop, looking up at Miguel.
It's him! I know who my great- great grandfather was!
Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!
I'm gonna be a musician!
It's not a fantasy! Miguel hands Papá the photo and points to the skull guitar.
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz! The greatest musician of all time!
But Papá, you said my family would guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my family! I'm supposed to play music!
If you would just let--
Just listen to me play--
I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda! Gasps from the family. Abuelita's brow hardens. She lifts the guitar in the air.
No!
I don't wanna be in this family! He snatches the photo from Papá and bolts out of the hacienda.
I wanna play in the plaza. Like de la Cruz! Can I still sign-up?
No... But if I can borrow a guitar--
Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar?
You guys have a spare guitar?
I need a guitar, just for a little bit--
Great-great grandfather... What am I supposed to do? No answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of the statue that reads ""Seize Your Moment!"" Miguel looks at the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea.
No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop! Cállate! Shhh! Miguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave, and chucks it. Dante bounds after the food.
I'm sorry... Timing to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb.
Señor de la Cruz? Please don't be mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great grandson... I need to borrow this. Heart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount. Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum begin to sparkle.
Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand, but I know you would have. You would've told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment! He backs up, in full view of the painting.
So if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza, just like you did!
I... I'm sorry! It's not what it looks like! De la Cruz is my... The groundskeeper walks straight through Miguel! He doesn't even see him!
Mamá!
Thanks, I-- They see each other face to face. The woman is a skeleton! Miguel screams! She does too! Miguel backs away. He turns to see another skeleton. He falls backwards and scoots away frantically. He bumps into another skeleton whose head falls off and lands in Miguel's hands.
Ahhh!
Dante?! You can see me? W-wait! What's going on?! Dante barks, points, and bounds through the crowd.
Dante! Dante! Miguel gives chase until -­ BAM! He runs smack into a mustached skeleton and falls to the ground. The skeleton's bones break apart and scatter. The head pops up.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
(muffled) Remind me how I know you?
Tía... Rosita?
Papá Julio?
Tía Victoria? Tía Victoria pokes Miguel's cheek, skeptical.
Tío Oscar? Tío Felipe?
Whoa... The bridge extends into the mist. A stream of skeletons amble across for the holiday.
Dante! Dante! Dante, wait up! Miguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes some petals into Miguel's face.
You gotta stay with me, boy. We don't know... where... Out of the mist, the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the Dead emerges. It's breathtaking. His family sidles up.
This isn't a dream, then. You're all really out there...
Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins.
Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be... As skeletons pass in the other direction, Miguel receives some strange looks. A little skeleton girl gasps, pointing at him.
Are those...? Alebrijes! But those are--
Hola. The arrivals agent's jaw literally drops.
Whoa... Skeletons stare at Miguel as he walks by. Suddenly Miguel notices Tío Oscar staring at his face in deep contemplation.
Mamá Imelda...
What?! The clerk searches through a huge stack of papers.
But I wasn't stealing the guitar!
It was my great-great grandfather's, he would have wanted me to have it--
Uh, you're all dead. Dante balances his paws at the edge of the clerk's desk and tries to reach a plate of food.
That's just Dante.
But Dante doesn't have any hair.
Oh... He unfolds the photo.
It was an accident! Mamá Imelda turns to the clerk, fire in her eyes.
That's it?
What happens at sunrise?
What? She can't do that!
Fine.
No skeletons! Miguel laughs, relieved. Then, a mischievous smile on his face, he turns and eyes de la Cruz's guitar. Miguel quickly grabs the guitar.
Mariachi Plaza, here I come-- He takes two steps toward the door, then WHOOOOSH!
This isn't fair, it's my life! You already had yours! Miguel grabs another petal, he marches over to Papá Julio.
Papá Julio, I ask for your blessing. Papá Julio shakes his head and pulls his hat down.
Tía Rosita? Oscar? Felipe? Tía Victoria? They all shake their heads.
You really hate music that much?
The same path he did. He gazes at the man with no face.
(to himself) He's family...
Con permiso, I... need to visit the restroom. Be right back! Miguel sees himself out. The family waits for a beat.
Vámonos. Miguel puts up his hood, tightening it to a tiny eye hole, and heads out. Dante pads after him.
If I wanna be a musician, I need a MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find my great-great grandpa. The exit gets closer when Miguel is stopped by a PATROLMAN.
No, no -- Dante!
Hey. Hey! You really know de la Cruz?
Shhh!
Yeah I'm alive. And if I wanna get back to the Land of the Living, I need de la Cruz's blessing.
He's my great-great-grandfather.
D'ya know what, maybe this isn't such a g--
That's nice! Miguel grabs Héctor by the wrist and drags him to the exit, away from his family.
You don't get to cross over.
This is you?
So you get me to my great-great grandpa, then I put up your photo when I get home?
Mmm, nope.
ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself. Miguel marches out of the alley, whistling for Dante to follow.
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.
It's how you walk.
Whoa...""Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!"" Qué padre!
And you can get us in!
Hey, you said you had front row tickets!
How?
Hola.
Dante... Dante! Miguel chases after him.
We shouldn't be in here... Miguel follows Dante through a giant warehouse, divided into different artists workspaces. He passes papier-mâché sculptures, giant paper cut out banners, a skeleton posing nude for a painter... Dante sniffs around. Suddenly an ALEBRIJE MONKEY jumps out at Dante. The monkey starts riding Dante, tormenting him. Miguel hustles after him.
No, no, Dante! Ven acá! The monkey jumps up onto the shoulder of FRIDA KAHLO, the REAL Frida Kahlo, who stands in front of a rehearsal stage. Miguel reins Dante in just as Frida turns to find them.
I just followed my--
I don't think he's a spirit guide.
I think it's just the right amount of obvious? (beat) It could use some music... Oh! What if you did, like, doonk-doonk- doonk-doonk... Frida, inspired, cues some musicians who start playing the tune.
Oh! And then it could go dittle- ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle- dittle-ittle -- WHAAA! The violins follow; a trombone punctuates.
Huh?
Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?
You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party.
If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you?
Chorizo?
Hey, I'm a musician.
I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing. Miguel looks up to Héctor.
You know where I can get a guitar? Héctor sighs.
My great-great grandpa was a musician.
Whadda you know? As Miguel descends the staircase, de la Cruz's distant glowing tower is obscured by old forgotten buildings.
So, how far is this guitar anyway?
These people are all your family?
Wait... what happened?
Where did he go?
But I've met him... I could remember him, when I go back...
You told me you hated musicians, you never said you were one.
No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time?
You don't know what you're talking about... The trolley arrives at the stop for the PLAZA DE LA CRUZ. There's a giant statue of Ernesto de la Cruz in the center. Miguel pockets Héctor's photo.
Definitely ""Remember Me."" Miguel plucks out the beginnings of de la Cruz's most famous song. Héctor clamps his hand over the fretboard.
C'mon, it's his most popular song!
Um... what about ""Poco Loco?""
I don't know -- I've never performed before.
I am! (beat) I mean I will be. Once I win.
No! I need to do this.
If I can't go out there and play one song... how can I call myself a musician?
'Cuz I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing. I need to prove that... that I'm worthy of it.
My best grito?
(uncertain) Ah -- ah -- ayyyyy yaaaaayyyyay... Dante whimpers.
Héctor...
(singing)
Not bad for a dead guy!
(singing)
We gotta get outta here.
I do have other family, but--
--But they hate music! I need a musician's blessing!
Oh, you're one to talk!
It's not stupid. Héctor grabs Miguel's arm and pulls him toward the stage.
Let go of me!
You don't wanna help me, you only care about yourself! Keep your dumb photo! He pulls Héctor's photo out of his pocket and throws it at him. Héctor tries to grab it but it catches a breeze and drifts into the crowd.
Stay away from me! As Héctor scrambles to catch his photo, Miguel runs away. Héctor looks up but Miguel is gone.
Dante, cállate! But Dante is insistent. He tugs at Miguel's pants, pulling him back to Héctor.
No, Dante! Stop it! He can't help me! Dante grabs onto his hoodie sleeve. Miguel tries to shake him off, but his hoodie slips off, revealing the arms of a living boy. Dante redoubles his efforts.
Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide, you're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here! Miguel yanks his hoodie away from Dante, who shrinks back, rebuffed. The scuffle has drawn the eyes of the crowd.
I don't want your blessing! Miguel scrambles upright and bounds for a narrow alley staircase.
You're ruining my life!
Music's the only thing that makes me happy. And you, you wanna take that away! (beat) You'll never understand. Miguel heads away from her up the stairs.
I thought you hated music.
But I don't wanna... pick sides! (beat) Why can't you be on MY side? That's what family's supposed to do -- support you. (beat) But you never will.
It's okay. I'm Ernesto's great- great grandson!
Disculpen, señores...
You too! Hey, musician to musician, I need a favor...
Thanks guys! The funicular ascends.
Whoa...
Gracias! Miguel heads off toward the mansion. On the stairs leading up, the party is bustling -- performers, servers and guests dressed to the nines. A fire breather lets out flames that transform into a flurry of butterflies.
De la Cruz...
Señor de la Cruz! Miguel elbows his way through the room.
Pardon me, Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la-- He finds himself in a huge hall with hundreds of guests, the heart of the party. Film clips play all around the room from de la Cruz's movies.
Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la-- Miguel is unable to get his great-great grandfather's attention. Meanwhile, a clip behind Miguel features de la Cruz as a good-natured priest:
(singing)
You... know about me?
I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson. More murmuring from the crowd. De la Cruz is shocked.
I need your blessing. So I can go back home and be a musician, just like you. (beat)
The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped you would?
Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple. De la Cruz laughs, delighted.
No -- it's all great.
It's just -- I've been looking up to you my whole life. You're the guy who actually did it! But... (beat) Did you ever regret it? Choosing music over... everything else. De la Cruz kneels down and looks into Miguel's eyes.
Leaving your family?
You mean it?!
I can't... I have to get home before sunrise.
I just met him tonight. He told me he knew you-- As Héctor steps forward with the photo, de la Cruz slowly recognizes him.
W-What?
That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all his own songs.
You really did play together...
Heaven and earth? Like in the movie?
That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in the de la Cruz movie, ""El Camino A Casa.""
No, it's in there. Look. Miguel looks around and points to the movie clip projected across the room.
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink...
Héctor!
You were going to give me your blessing...
That you murdered Héctor... for his songs?
I -- no! Everyone knows you're the... the good guy. Doubt enters Miguel's mind. De la Cruz darkens, he places the photo of Héctor in his coat pocket, gears turning in his mind.
Papá Ernesto? My blessing? De la Cruz crumples the marigold petal.
What?! But I'm your family!
No, NO!
Let go! They throw him into a cenote, an inescapable sinkhole behind the estate.
Help! Can anyone hear me? I wanna go home! Miguel collapses on the stone island. His soaked hoodie sags off his shoulders. The skeletal transition is almost complete. A moment of silence. He is alone. Suddenly, Miguel hears a noise. Footsteps. Héctor emerges from the darkness, looking beat up. Héctor stumbles.
Héctor?
Oh, Héctor! They run to each other. Héctor embraces Miguel. But Miguel is overcome with shame.
You were right. I should have gone back to my family-- Héctor tries to calm him but Miguel is shaking.
They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen--
I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda. Héctor holds Miguel to his chest. Miguel is tense.
I told them I didn't care. Suddenly, a golden flicker flutters through Héctor's bones, and he falls to his knees.
Héctor! Héctor--
Who?
She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge...
Coco? Miguel reaches into his hoodie and pulls out the photo of Imelda, Coco, and the faceless musician. Miguel shows the photo to Héctor. Héctor is confused; it's like he's seen a ghost.
That's my Mamá Coco. That's my Mamá Imelda. Is that... you? Gears turn in both of their heads.
You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her...
He stole your guitar... He stole your songs... (beat)
You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz!
Are you kidding? A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer. You're a total upgrade! Héctor doesn't smile. Miguel kneels close.
My whole life, there's been something that made me different... and I never knew where it came from. (beat) But now I know. It comes from you. (beat) I'm proud we're family! Miguel looks up defiantly at the hole in the cenote.
I'm proud to be his family!
Dante?
Dante! It's Dante! Dante pants and wags his tail happily. Behind him Pepita peeks down through the hole and gives a powerful roar. Pepita's call shakes the cavern. She lowers her head to reveal Mamá Imelda riding atop her. Miguel and Mamá Imelda laugh with joy. Until her gaze falls upon Héctor.
Dante, you knew he was my Papá Héctor the whole time! You ARE a real spirit guide! (doggy-praise) Who's a good spirit guide? You are! Dante smiles at Miguel dumbly. Suddenly, before Miguel's eyes, neon patterns spread outward from the dog's paws. Dante begins to freak out.
Whoa... A pair of little wings sprout on the dog's back. He spreads them. He jumps up to fly... and plummets beneath the clouds!
Dante!
I wasn't in there `cause of Héctor. He was in there `cause of me. (beat) He was just trying to get me home... I didn't wanna listen, but he was right... nothing is more important than family. Mamá Imelda looks at Héctor, shocked to hear the sentiment.
I'm ready to accept your blessing... and your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get Héctor's photo.
So he can see Coco again. Héctor should be on our ofrenda. He's part of our family--
He tried to go home to you and Coco... but de la Cruz murdered him! Startled, she looks to Héctor for confirmation.
Héctor?
You don't have to forgive him... But we shouldn't forget him.
Family comes first. Mamá Imelda considers. She turns to Héctor.
I might know a way...
Gracias Frida!
Ow! Dante has snuck in under Tío Oscar's skirt. Héctor sees that Imelda is tangled up in her outfit.
Everyone clear on the plan?
She's talking about me! De la Cruz sees the three of them and puts the pieces together.
The photo! The rest of the Riveras emerge from the corridor. Outnumbered, de la Cruz turns and runs.
That's what I heard... A brawl ensues between the family and the guards. De la Cruz runs to a stage door.
Hurry, come on! Papá Julio, Tío Oscar, and Tío Felipe block the guards from following the others.
Ahem.
Never play music again... Imelda smiles.
Dante! De la Cruz pulls Miguel away, closer to the ledge of the building. Héctor struggles but continues pursuing de la Cruz.
You're a coward!
Héctor's the real musician, you're just the guy who murdered him and stole his songs!
Good boy, Dante. Imelda runs to Miguel and embraces him.
Héctor! The photo, I lost it...
Héctor! Héctor?! Héctor can barely move his limbs.
No! We can still find the photo... Mamá Imelda looks to the horizon, the first rays of sunlight peeking over.
No, no, no, I can't leave you. I promised I'd put your photo up. I promised you'd see Coco! Héctor looks at Miguel. The skeletal transformation is creeping in on the edges of Miguel's face. He's almost full skeleton now.
No, no... she can't forget you!
Héctor--
No, Papá Héctor, please! Imelda and Héctor move their joined hands toward Miguel's chest.
No... Héctor's eyelids begin to close.
I promise I won't let Coco forget you! Aaahh!-- WHOOOOSH! A whirlwind of marigold petals, and everything goes white.
Ah! I need to see Mamá Coco, please-- Abuelita spies the guitar in Miguel's hand.
Mamá Coco? Can you hear me? It's Miguel. Miguel looks into her eyes.
I saw your papá. Remember? Papá? Please -- if you forget him, he'll be gone... forever! She doesn't respond. Miguel's father bangs on the door.
Here -- this was his guitar, right? He used to play it to you? See, there he is. Still nothing. Her eyes are glazed.
Papá, remember? Papá? Mamá Coco stares forward, as if Miguel isn't even there.
Mamá Coco, please, don't forget him. With a rattle of keys, the door flies open. The family pours in.
I'm sorry, Papá. Mamá steps forward.
Not all of us... Abuelita returns from consoling Mamá Coco.
Mamá Coco... His toe accidentally taps against Héctor's skull guitar, a soft hollow ringing resonates.
Mamá Coco? Your papá -- he wanted you to have this. He picks up the guitar. Abuelita steps forward to intervene but Papá places a hand on her shoulder.
(singing)
He loved you, Mamá Coco. Your papá loved you so much. A smile spreads across Mamá Coco's face. She's waited a long time to hear those words. She turns to her nightstand, hand shaking. She opens a drawer and pulls out a notebook.
...And there's Tía Rosita... and your Tía Victoria... and those two are Oscar and Felipe. These aren't just old pictures -- they're our family -- and they're counting on us to remember them. Abuelita approaches and smiles to see her grandson passing on the tradition. Then she places a picture frame on the ofrenda, a photo of Mamá Coco. She looks to Miguel who puts his arm around her. Next to Mamá Coco's picture sits the photo of Mamá Imelda and Héctor, taped back together. Restored.

Are you all right, niño? Miguel looks up, mortified. His painted face begins to run, revealing him to be a living boy. De la Cruz's eyes go wide. The crowd gasps and murmurs.
It's you... you, you are that boy, the one who came from the Land of the Living.
You are all anyone has been talking about! Why have you come here?
I... have a great-great grandson?
My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen? Miguel hugs de la Cruz who sweeps Miguel up onto his shoulders, showing him off to the room.
Hey Negrete! Infante! Have you met my great-great-grandson?
My great-great grandson!
He's alive! And a musician to boot!
No dimple!
You know, I did all my own stunts.
All of this came from my amazing fans in the Land of the Living! They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with! Miguel takes in the room, it's almost too much to absorb. Something seems to be on the boy's mind.
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much? You look overwhelmed...
But...?
It was hard. Saying goodbye to my hometown. Heading off on my own...
Sí. But I could not have done it differently. (beat) One cannot deny who one is meant to be. And you, my great-great grandson, are meant to be a musician! Miguel smiles, chest swelling. He feels validated for the first time in his life.
You and I, we are artists, Miguel! We cannot belong to one family. The world is our family! De la Cruz gestures to the sparkling city beyond his hilltop estate. Fireworks go off on the veranda.
Ooo, the fireworks have begun!
Soon, the party will move across town for my ""Sunrise Spectacular!"" (beat) Miguel, you must come to the show! You will be my guest of honor! Miguel's eyes light up.
Of course, my boy! Miguel's chest swells. Then deflates. He lifts his shirt, revealing the skeletal transition partway up his torso.
Oh, I really do need to get you home. De la Cruz plucks a marigold petal from a vase.
It has been an honor. I am sorry to see you go, Miguel. I hope you die very soon. (beat) You know what I mean. (beat) Miguel. I give you my bles--
Who are you? What is the meaning of this? From the shadows, Héctor, dressed as Frida, steps into the light.
Oh, Frida! I thought you couldn't make it. Héctor takes off the wig and throws his outfit off.
(to Miguel) You know this, uh... man?
Hé-- Héctor?
My friend... you're being forgotten...
Héctor, please--
Héctor, I never meant to take credit. (beat)
We made a great team but -- you died and I -- I only sang your songs because I wanted to keep a part of you alive.
Héctor...
That was a long time ago.
You're confusing movies with reality, Héctor.
Security! Security! Miguel watches as Héctor and Ernesto scuffle on the floor.
Have him taken care of. He's not well. The guards drag Héctor through a wide doorway.
I apologize. Where were we?
Yes. Uh... sí. De la Cruz pulls up a marigold petal, but hesitates.
Miguel, my reputation, it is very important to me. I would hate to have you think...
You don't think that. Do you?
Security! De la Cruz's guards appear in the doorway.
Take care of Miguel. He'll be extending his stay. The guards grab Miguel by the shoulder.
And Héctor was my best friend. Miguel goes pale.
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel. You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to... seize your moment. I know you understand. Miguel is dragged away.
Yes?
Don't I know you? Imelda pulls off her shoe and slaps de la Cruz across the face with it.
(disoriented) Who the? Héctor leaps out from around the corner.
Héctor?! How did you-- Imelda slaps de la Cruz again.
Grandson? Now Miguel leaps out of the corridor.
You! Wait, you're related to Héctor? Miguel sees the photo in de la Cruz's pocket.
Security! Ayúdenme! The Riveras flood out after him. Héctor jogs next to Imelda.
Get her off the stage! His guards hustle onto the stage, scaling the set to get to her.
You're not going anywhere! Suddenly Miguel is yanked away from his great-great grandparents by de la Cruz. De la Cruz has grabbed Miguel by the scruff of his hoodie. Imelda lunges at de la Cruz, but he pushes her to the floor.
Stay back! Stay back. All of you!
Stay back! Not one more step. Dante growls and tries to grab Miguel.
I've worked too hard, Héctor... Too hard to let him destroy everything... In the stage wings, Tía Rosita commandeers one of the cameras and points it toward de la Cruz. Tía Victoria sidles up to a control board and pushes a volume dial up.
He's a threat!
You think I'd let him go back to the land of the living with your photo? To keep your memory alive? (beat) No.
I am Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time!
I am the one who is willing to do what it takes to seize my moment... (darkening) Whatever it takes. Suddenly, de la Cruz throws Miguel off of the structure.
Apologies old friend, but the show must go on...
Ha ha! He is met with boos. He looks confused.
Please, please, mi familia...
Orchestra! A-one-A-two-A-one-- The conductor snaps his baton. More booing.
(singing)
Nice kitty... Suddenly Pepita head-butts de la Cruz and lifts him into the sky, flinging the singer in the air like a kitten playing with a ball of yarn.
AAAHHHH! Put me down! No, please! I beg of you, stop! Stop! NO! She swings him around to gain momentum, then throws him over the audience.
","Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. (beat) Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on so many ofrendas, it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingie... The monitor scans him, but an ""X"" appears, accompanied by a negative buzzing sound.
Okay, when I said I was Frida... just now? That... that was a lie. And I apologize for doing that.
You know what, I'm just gonna zip right over, you won't even know I'm gone. Héctor bolts for the bridge. A security guards blocks the gate. Héctor splits in two and slides past the guard, half going over, half under.
Ha HA! Héctor reaches the bridge at a sprint, but the magic doesn't engage; he sinks right into the petals.
Almost there, just a little further...! The guards saunter to the bridge and casually pull Héctor back toward the Land of the Dead.
Fine, okay. Fine, who cares... Dumb flower bridge! Miguel watches as the guards haul him out. Tía Rosita looks up in time to see his back.
That's illegal?
Amigo? (verklempt) Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say that, because... (misty) I've just had a really hard Día de Muertos, and I could really use an amigo right now. Héctor leans gratefully toward the officer, overwhelmed with mock emotion.
And amigos, they help their amigos. Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight and I'll make it worth your while. Héctor spies a de la Cruz poster at the officer's workstation.
Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I go way back! I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular Show! Miguel perks at the mention of de la Cruz.
I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you can meet him! (beat) You just gotta let me cross that bridge! The corrections officer pulls away.
Can I at least get my costume back?
Some amigo... Miguel follows him.
Who wants to-- (noticing Miguel) Ah! You're alive!
That's weirdly specific.
He's your wha-whaat...? Hector's eyes drop into his mouth. He pops them back up with a punch to his jaw. Miguel is a little grossed out. Héctor turns to conference with himself.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait... (gasp) Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait? (beat) Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living?!
No, niño, niño, niño, I can help you! You can help me. We can help each other! But most importantly, you can help ME. Miguel suddenly spies his family hurrying down a staircase. Mamá Imelda spots Miguel.
I'm Héctor.
Espérame chamaco! Miguel throws the arm back to Héctor an they disappear into a dense crowd. Moments later, the Dead Riveras burst from the revolving doors. Mamá Imelda scours the crowd for Miguel. He's nowhere to be found.
Hey, hey, hold still. (beat) Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver... look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da! Héctor opens a small mirror. Miguel's face is painted to look like a skeleton.
Dead as a doorknob. (beat) So listen, Miguel: this place runs on memories. When you're well- remembered, people put up your photo and you get to cross the bridge and visit the living on Día de Muertos. (beat) Unless you're me.
No one's ever put up my picture... (beat) But you can change that! He unfolds an old picture. In it is a young, living Héctor.
Muy guapo, eh?
Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! (beat) One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough guy to get to. And I need to cross that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT. (upbeat) So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more... accessible?
Don't yank my chain, chamaco. You gotta have SOME other family.
Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine! I'll get you to your great-great grandpa...!
...It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man. (beat) What are you doing? Miguel slink-walks next to Héctor goofily.
No, skeletons don't walk like that.
No, I don't. Miguel keeps walking funny.
Stop it! Miguel notices a billboard advertising ""ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ'S SUNRISE SPECTACULAR!;"" ""Remember Me"" blares from attached speakers.
Blech. Every year, your great- great grandpa puts on that dumb show to mark the end of Día de Muertos.
Ahhhh--
That... that was a lie. I apologize for that. Miguel gives Héctor a withering look.
Cool off, chamaco, come on... I'll get you to him.
'Cause I happen to know where he's rehearsing!
Hola, Ceci!
Ceci, I lost the dress--
Ceci -- I know, Ceci. I know, I know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci. Ceci... As Héctor tries to talk her down, Dante wanders away from the costume area.
Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities... Héctor pulls Miguel away, but Miguel won't be wrangled.
That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?
He's YOUR great-great grandpa. How come he didn't invite YOU? Héctor walks away from Miguel toward the musicians.
Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party?
Ha ha, very funny guys. Very funny.
I don't want to talk about it.
I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference! More laughter.
(to Miguel) This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks!
You are?
No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think-- Miguel looks to his hands, progressed in their skeletal transformation.
I know a guy...
Why the heck would you wanna be a musician?
...Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. Blech, no, no thank you, guácala, no...
We're almost there...
Keep up, chamaco, come on! Héctor leads Miguel through a stone archway.
Eh! These guys!
Hey Tío! Qué onda!
Eh, in a way... We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas, no family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know? (beat) So, we all call each other cousin, or tío, or whatever. They approach three old ladies playing cards around a wooden crate. One, TÍA CHELO looks up.
Tía Chelo! He-hey! Héctor hands them a bottle.
Hey, hey! Save some for me! Is Chicharrón around?
Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Héctor?
Buenas noches, Chicharrón!
C'mon, it's Día de Muertos! I brought you a little offering!
I would, Cheech, but the thing is... me and my friend, Miguel, we really need to borrow your guitar.
Yes?
I promise we'll bring it right back. Chicharrón sits up, incensed.
Uh...
Ah, you see­-
No, no, not like those times.
Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?
You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar's for the kid--
Only for you, amigo. Any requests? Héctor begins tuning the guitar.
(singing)
There are children present. (continuing)
He's been forgotten. (beat) When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the ""Final Death.""
No one knows. Miguel has a thought.
No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories... they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life -- in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories... Miguel is deep in thought. Héctor puts his hand on Miguel's back, suddenly cheerful.
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually. He gives Miguel the guitar.
C'mon ""de la Cruzcito."" You've got a contest to win.
How do you think I knew your great- great grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows. Héctor plays a fancy riff, but botches the last note.
Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe but his music, eh, not so much.
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz! (beat) Showtime, chamaco! Héctor hands the guitar to Miguel. QUICK CUTS: Energetic plaza shots. Lights and colors, beautiful dresses, violins, pyrotechnic bullfight, dancing. A t-shirt vendor is selling ""de la Cruz"" shirts.
That's our ticket, muchacho.
So what's the plan? What are you gonna play?
No, not that one. No.
Ehck, it's too popular. Elsewhere backstage, they notice multiple other acts rehearsing their versions.
Epa! Now that's a song!
You always this nervous before a performance?
What?! You said you were a musician!
That's your plan?! (beat) No, no, no, no, no, you have to win, Miguel. Your life LITERALLY depends on you winning! AND YOU'VE
I'll go up there-- Miguel recoils, keeping hold of the instrument.
Why?
What does that matter?!
Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment... at SUCH a bad time! Héctor looks in Miguel's eyes. The kid is sincere. Despite himself, Héctor softens.
Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. (beat) Okay. (beat) Okay you wanna perform? Then you've got to PERFORM! Miguel perks, surprised that Héctor wants to help.
First you have to loosen up. Shake off those nerves! Sáquenlo sáquenlo, sáquenlo! Héctor does a loose-bone skeletal shimmy and Miguel copies.
Now gimme your best grito!
Come on, yell! Belt it out! OOOOOOH HE-HE-HEY! Ha! Ah, feels good! Okay... now you.
Oh, c'mon kid... On stage, Los Chachalacos wrap up to raucous applause.
Miguel, look at me.
Hey! Hey, look at me. (beat)
You can do this. Grab their attention and don't let it go!
Make 'em listen, chamaco! You got this!
Arre papá! Hey! Héctor's face contorts with a mix of encouragement and dread.
(to Dante) What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?
No, no, no, no... Once in the spotlight, Héctor warms up and busts out some percussive footwork to Miguel's guitar.
You're not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso!
(singing)
Hey, you did good! I'm proud of you! Eso! Miguel swells and looks back out the crowd when he suddenly spots Oscar and Felipe talking to a stranger. He looks over and there is Tía Rosita talking to someone else! Miguel looks to stage right, where he sees Papá Julio talking to the Emcee!
Hey, where are you going?
What, are you crazy? We're about to win this thing!
Wait, wait, wait! You said de la Cruz was your ONLY family. The ONLY person who could send you home.
You could have taken my photo back this whole time?!
You lied to me!
Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel. I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night! (beat) I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge 'cause you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy!
I'm taking you to your family.
You'll thank me later--
No -- no, no, no! No...
Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?! Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!
Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. The security guard lets her in immediately. No need to check the list.
Gracias... Hector steps onto the funicular, readjusting his unibrow to maintain his diguise.
You said you'd take back my photo. You promised, Miguel. Miguel turns, backing into de la Cruz's arms. De la Cruz rises to his feet, hands defensively on Miguel's shoulders.
Please Miguel, put my photo up. Héctor pushes the photo into Miguel's hands. De la Cruz intercepts it. He looks from the picture to the gray, faded skeleton who kneels before him. Héctor looks weak.
And whose fault is that?
Those were MY songs you took. MY songs that made YOU famous.
If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them--
(to de la Cruz) You wanna tell him, or should I?
Oh, how generous.
Look, I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up--
--And I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl. De la Cruz looks at the photo, deliberating.
Ernesto... Remember the night I left?
We drank together and you told me you would move heaven and earth for your amigo. Well, I'm asking you to now.
What?
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
That night, Ernesto. The night I left...
You... POISONED me.
All this time I thought it was just bad luck.
I never thought that you might have... that you...
How could you?!
You took everything away from me! Security guards rush in to pull Héctor off Ernesto. Héctor struggles, but it's no use.
You rat!
I just wanted to go back home! No, no, NO! The doors slam shut and cut off his shouts. Miguel is left alone with de la Cruz.
Kid?
Hey -- hey, hey...
Hey, it's okay...
Hey, chamaco, it's okay. It's okay.
Hhuuh!
She's... forgetting me. Miguel looks at Héctor with concern.
My daughter...
I just wanted to see her again... (beat) I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her papá was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. (beat) My Coco... A chill runs through Miguel.
Where... where did you get this?
We're...
I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me... maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. (beat) You know the worst part? (beat) Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug... (beat) But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world...
...Ever again. Héctor is quiet for a moment.
You know, I wrote her a song once. We used to sing it every night at the same time, no matter how far apart we were. What I wouldn't give to sing it to her... one last time.
(singing)
(singing)
I didn't write ""Remember Me"" for the world... I wrote it for Coco. I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great grandpa.
Imelda!
You look good...
Imelda--
It's true, Imelda. Imelda wrestles with her emotions.
Imelda, I-- Héctor's body suddenly shimmers, leaving him winded. Imelda gasps.
I'm running out of time. It's Coco...
This is my fault, not yours. (beat) I'm sorry, Imelda. Mamá Imelda, holding in her emotions, turns to Miguel.
Here, let me help you with--
Got your petals? Each family member raises a marigold petal. Imelda leads the way out of the corridor.
She's talking about me! (to Imelda) I'm the love of your life?
You said ""love of your life...""
You... still got it. They smile at each other, softening. Miguel, off to the side, clears his throat.
You're going home.
Imelda-- De la Cruz drags Miguel away as his family encroaches.
(winded) Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone! Héctor stumbles, shimmering like before. He falls to the ground.
He's a living child, Ernesto!
It's okay, mijo. It's-- Suddenly Héctor suffers his most violent flickering yet. He collapses. Miguel kneels by him.
Coco...
We're both out of time, mijo. The shimmering of Héctor's bones advances.
I just wanted her to know that I loved her. Héctor musters the strength to grab the marigold petal.
You have our blessing, Miguel.
Go home...
Coco!
","I demand to speak to the person in charge! A beleaguered CASE WORKER cringes as Mamá Imelda tears into her.
My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts my photo on the ofrenda! That devil box tells you nothing but lies! In a swift movement, Mamá Imelda removes her shoe and smacks the computer.
Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let me cross the bridge! Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda.
What?!
Miguel?
What is going on? Just then, a door opens and a CLERK pokes his head out.
Guitar...?
Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of that... (disgust) ...musician! He is DEAD to this family!
But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over. Miguel realizes something. He sheepishly pulls out the folded photo.
You took my photo off the ofrenda?!
How do we send him back?!
Miguel.
I give you my blessing. The marigold petal glows in her fingers. Miguel brightens. But Mamá Imelda is not finished.
I give you my blessing to go home... The glow of the marigold petal surges.
To put my photo back on the ofrenda... Each added condition makes the petal glow brighter. Imelda delivers it like a scolding, but Miguel nods.
And to never play music again! The petal surges one last time.
Two seconds and you already break your promise!
Don't make this hard, mijo. You go home my way, or no way.
I will not let you go down the same path he did. Miguel gets an idea. He pulls the photo out and turns from the group.
Miguel!
Ay, he is going to get himself killed... I need my spirit guide, Pepita. Mamá Imelda looks to the night sky, puts two fingers to her mouth, and lets out a piercing whistle.
Who has that petal Miguel touched?
Have you found him, Pepita? Have you found our boy? Pepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint. It glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect.
Miguel. Pepita leans forward, breathes again, and the glow spreads to reveal a trail of footprints.
He's close. Find him. The Dead Riveras fan out through the audience.
This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I am giving you my blessing and you are going home!
Miguel! Stop! Not able to get through on her spirit guide, Imelda is forced to pursue Miguel on foot.
Come back! Miguel! He wriggles through an iron gate.
I am trying to save your life! She is stopped by the gate.
What?
(singing)
Oh, I loved it. (reminiscing) I remember that feeling, when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered. But when we had Coco, suddenly... there was something in my life that mattered more than music. I wanted to put down roots. He wanted to play for the world. Mamá Imelda pauses for a moment, lost in a memory.
We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted. Now you must make a choice.
(icy) Héctor.
Mijo, I was so worried! Thank goodness we found you in time! Imelda's eyes fall on Héctor, who holds his hat in his hands sheepishly.
And you! How many times must I turn you away?
I want nothing to do with you. Not in life, not in death! (beat) I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes. He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole! Miguel steps between Imelda and Héctor.
What?
He left this family!
And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise and I'm just supposed to forgive you?
She's forgetting you...
(to Héctor) I wanted to forget you. I wanted Coco to forget you too, but--
Miguel, if we help you get his photo... you will return home? No more music?
I -- I can't forgive you. But I will help you. Miguel smiles.
(to Miguel) So how do we get to de la Cruz? Miguel furrows his brow.
Don't touch me. The family joins together in a huddle.
Send Miguel home.
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz-- Right around the corner is de la Cruz who turns with a smile.
Ah! The family stops in their tracks, still hidden from de la Cruz's view. It's just him and Imelda. His smile drops.
That's for murdering the love of my life!
I don't know! I'm still angry at you.
And that's for trying to murder my grandson!
After him!
I don't know WHAT I said!
Miguel! I have it! Miguel turns toward Imelda but is chased by guards. Suddenly, Imelda rises into the air. She is on de la Cruz's rising platform! She is lifted through the ceiling and up to the stage. De la Cruz hurries up the stairs after her. Miguel is detained by a security guard when Dante flies in and knocks the guard's head clean off. Miguel, Héctor, Tía Victoria, and Tía Rosita hurry up the stairs after de la Cruz.
(singing)
Let go of me!
I forgot what that felt like. Héctor is taken by surprise. Imelda, realizing the impropriety, pulls away from him awkwardly.
Oh! Imelda, now reminded, gives Miguel the photo. She pulls out her petal.
Miguel, I give you my blessing. The petal glows.
To go home... to put up our photos... (beat) And to never... Miguel looks slightly saddened, anticipating the condition.
To never... forget how much your family loves you. The petal surges. Miguel brightens, touched.
Miguel!
Miguel! Behind them, Héctor struggles to get to his feet but stumbles with a flicker. Miguel runs to support him.
Miguel, it's almost sunrise!
No conditions. The petal glows. Héctor struggles to lift the petal to Miguel. Mamá Imelda takes his hand in hers.
","Miguel! Eat your food. Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain. She gives Mamá Coco a kiss on the head.
Aw, you're a twig, mijo. Have some more.
I asked if you would like more tamales.
That's what I THOUGHT you said.
No music!
No music!!
What are you doing here?
You leave my grandson alone!
I know your tricks, mariachi! (to Miguel) What did he say to you?
My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito -- he wants no part of your music, mariachi! You keep away from him! The mariachi scrambles away, snatching his hat off the ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to her bosom.
Ay, pobrecito! Estás bien, mijo? She peppers him with kisses then releases him from the embrace. He gasps for air.
(distressed) You know better than to be here in this place! You will come home. Now.
Go away, you! Go! Dante darts off, scared.
Never name a street dog. They'll follow you forever. (beat) Now, go get my shoe.
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza!
It's Día de los Muertos -- no one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family. She deposits a pile of marigolds in Miguel's arms.
Ofrenda room. Vámonos.
Don't give me that look. Día de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us. (beat) We've put their photos on the ofrenda so their spirits can cross over. That is very important! If we don't put them up, they can't come! (beat) We made all this food -- set out the things they loved in life, mijo. All this work to bring the family together. I don't want you sneaking off to who-knows-where. She looks up to find Miguel sneaking away.
Where are you going?
Ay, Dios mío... Being part of this family means being HERE for this family... I don't want to see you end up like-- Abuelita looks up to the photo of the faceless musician.
Never mention that man! He's better off forgotten.
Ta, ta, ta-tch!
Tch-tch!
Tch!
Tch-tch!
Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.
No Mamá. It's okay, I'm here. Mamá Coco looks up at Abuelita.
Rest, Mamá. Abuelita returns to the ofrenda.
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel. (beat) Miguel... Miguel? She looks around the room. Miguel is nowhere to be found. Abuelita steps up to the ofrenda.
(sigh) What are we going to do with that boy...? She looks to the photo of Mamá Imelda. Abuelita's eyes brighten with an idea.
You're right. That's just what he needs!
Día de los Muertos has begun! In the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter marigold petals from their baskets.
In the courtyard, mijos.
Sí. Next to the other one.
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on the family tradition! And on Día de los Muertos! Your ancestors will be so proud! She gestures to the shoes adorning the ofrenda.
You'll craft huaraches just like your Tía Victoria.
What is all this? You keep secrets from your own family?
Never! That man's music was a curse! I will not allow it!
You want to end up like that man? Forgotten? Left off your family's ofrenda?!
There. No guitar, no music. (softening)
Come. You'll feel better after you eat with your family. She reaches out to comfort Miguel, but he is hurt beyond repair.
Where have you been?!
What are you doing with that? Give it to me! Miguel pushes past Abuelita, and slams the door shut.
Miguel! Stop! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! MIGUEL!
What are you doing to that poor woman? Abuelita brushes Miguel aside to comfort her mother.
It's okay, Mamita, it's okay.
It's okay, mamita. (beat) Miguel, you apologize to your Mamá Coco! Miguel looks at Mamá Coco and approaches her.
Well? Apologize. He comes to a realization.
Nothing Mamá. Nothing at all. Mamá Coco turns to Miguel.
