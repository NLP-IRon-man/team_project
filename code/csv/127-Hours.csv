txt,"Nearly missed it!
Hey. Are you doing the east pike? Can I come along with you for a while? The girls don't reply, just look at each other.
I'm on my own. I'm Aron.
Nice to meet you. What a day.
Did you bike or come straight from the trail head?
I left mine at the Horseshoe Canyon and biked here.
17 and windy. The girls exchange glances.
I do this a lot. They laugh. He's crazy, but harmless.
Wasn't expecting to see anyone in the canyon today.
Sorry.
Yeah, I know, I mean there's no one around for 50 miles.
Let me guess... You're here for the paintings or the Cathedral?
The climb's a little tricky but it's worth it.
There's thousands of holds but you can't see them until you're almost upside down and then they just keep appearing... it's a bit of a act of faith so I'll go first... take off as much as you dare as there's a bit of a surprise at the other end...
I swear I won't look but I swear you won't care when you get out here... We've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider style. He's stripped to his underwear. He's lithe to say the least. We can't see the girls or what's underneath us but there's a feeling of the vertiginous, as much from the weird echo and the sense of reflected light as from the scale of the dome.
... and the thing is, when you get to the middle... He lets go.
... there aren't any more. We spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald pool 60 feet below.
Well, there's not really anyone special.
Long story.
Well I figure no one else is mad enough to climb in the winter.
What? No.
Just like a MOTEL 6 then?
Solitude. Great tunes. Empty mind. He indicates the wilderness.
And I can sing Phish songs as loud as I like.
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'll get this. Leave no trace.
Hey, but I like a beer like the next man. You know, end of the day.
I'm not certified yet but that's what I want to do.
It's hard to get the hours to qualify. Catch 22.
Great. Now put your ass on my head.
(at his most instructor- ish, talking all the time as he makes his way down) You'll have to chimney down a little ways - like here, watch - one foot on each wall then squat onto your right heel, now your butt's on the wall, so you can move your right foot across, now put your left foot under your butt lower down and scootch your butt down - watch that black part, it's slick, slime, try not to get it on your shoes - if you can get to these bomber handholds here it's like an elevator shaft and just think friction to control the slide. This is a keeper so always have someone at the bottom to boost you out. He looks up to them.
Why don't you come with me to the Big Drop Rappel? I can give you a lift back to your car.
About another 8 miles or so, I think.
No, I really got to do this. Anyway I've my miner's lamp.
No, it's great for seeing snakes in hand holds. Can I get a picture then? They pose with raven feathers in their hair.
Listen, my friends are having a party tomorrow night. You should come.
Drive on the east road and about 40 miles out there's a huge inflatable Scooby Doo. You can't miss it. Turn off and it's about 2 miles down that track. Starts late and it'll go right thru. Lots of cheek kissing and his last picture of them...
No, I really got to do this.
That's the one. I'll have 3 cold beers waiting for us.
Easy Aron, easy now. He keeps moving, descending still, but a little more circumspect. He lets the change of pace allow him to whip round his pack and with the practice of thousands of times selects and plays a CD without stopping, slipping the headphones over his head.
Won't be coming back this way.
Yep. And across he steps onto it. It holds.
FUCK, get your hand out of there! Pulls and pulls, yanks until his shoulder will dislocate, but nothing moves. Sweat, anxiety flaring, hot pain.



No, no... more water. He caps the lid tightly and drops it into his pack.
Relax. Stop. Come on. He breathes and breathes, taking stock for the 1st time.
FUCK! What the fuck? How the fuck did you get your hand trapped by a fucking boulder? Its crushed, it's fucking dying man! He reaches up and touches the trail of blood, hair and skin left on the canyon wall as the rock pushed him to where he is. Looks under boulder, no blood - check. [He hears the crowd cheering on his headphones. It's been playing throughout. He switches it off] He looks above for the first time.

Not good. He blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust.
When in a hole.... Alternative; he starts digging away at the wall instead, same result.
Fuck. It's hard as iron. Pause. You're gonna have to cut your arm off. As if to answer that idea we...

Shit! He pulls off his right sock and shoe and tries to squeeze his foot into the hole. Too big. Size 10. He looks upward. He can't believe he's done it.
Shit!!!
Sweet.
Cool. He picks it off his arm and places it on top of the rock next to where he's working. It's a grain of sand on the seashore but it's something. Boy, his arm and his legs are aching now.
Aahhhhh. Lovely relief for him, light off, his eyes close.
Caw-caw. As he stretches his neck to follow the path of the only other living thing, he freezes stock still. The bird has gone. Nothing moves. Not him.... nothing. Time passes. He switches his light off.
It's three-oh-five on Sunday. This marks my twenty-four-hour mark of being stuck in Blue John Canyon above the Big Drop. My name is Aron Ralston. My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of Englewood, Colorado. Whoever finds this, please make an attempt to get this to them. Be sure of it. I would appreciate it. He takes long blinks and seems to avoid looking at himself though the screen is facing him. He looks alarmed and wide eyed, startled, in contrast to his slow slurred delivery.
So... I was hiking Blue John Canyon yesterday... and this happened. He pulls the camera round to show where his forearm and wrist disappear into the horrifyingly skinny gap between the chockstone and the wall. As he does that we
What you're looking at there is my arm, going into the rock... and there it is, stuck. It's been without circulation for 24 hours.
It's pretty well gone. If the colour doesn't come across on the video, it's grey and blue.
Unnhhhhh.......I'm in deep stuff.
So I have very little water. He can't help look in the camera towards those who know what that means in this place.
Yeah, I have about a third of a litre left. He picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the camera.
So the way I see it... there's kind of four things happening here... I tried to move it with some rigging... useless... and I tried chipping away at the rock... I think part of the problem is, is that my hand is actually supporting the rock. Which means every time I chip away the rock moves a bit and settles onto my hand again. I can't feel it happening but microscopically, it seems to be, because the little gap over there between the rock and the wall seems to be getting smaller. And this chockstone is the hardest thing here.
So the third thing left was to cut my arm off.
I don't know whether I could do that but it's pretty much suicide. It's four hours to my vehicle that way and with very difficult climbing with one hand and the bike is like two, two and a half hours, that way but the climbing... fourth class climbing... which I think will be probably impossible with one hand... between the blood loss and the dehydration I think I would die if I cut off my arm.
Which means I'm waiting for someone to come along. He summons up the guts to let the evidence out.
I didn't tell anyone where I was going and I didn't leave a note on the truck.
Dumb. The video whirrs on until he suddenly looks straight into the lens.

No one's coming Aron. He rewinds to the end of the message and erases his futile calls for help.
God, I am praying to you for guidance. I'm trapped in Blue John Canyon - you probably know that - and I don't know what I am supposed to do. I've tried everything I can think of. I need some new ideas. Please show me a sign. PAUSE - Just his breath. He switches on the head lamp and the inside of the bag explodes with light. There's enough light for any kind of heaven but it's just Aron in Blue John Canyon. He looks around his bag. He stops. Silence. Only his breathing to listen to. Heart rate... fast... too fast. Light off.
OK, then, God, since you're apparently busy: Devil, if you're listening, I need some help here. I'll trade you my arm, my soul, whatever you want. Just get me out of here. You want me never to climb again, I can give that up. Just show me the dotted line.
Ungg-gggu-ggga-gggngh! His throat uncontrollably shudders and splutters as his teeth rattle with cold suddenly. It does sound like a demonic fit from the multi-coloured headless man.
Yeah. Not very funny.
Still not sure. I'll see you Tuesday.
Always do.
It's freaking me out looking at myself so I hope you guys are OK with this
It's Monday - all day - bummer. I spent the morning trying to create a 6:1 system ration and lift the boulder but friction between the rope and carabiners is dissipating every bit of force I apply.
All it's good for is sitting in...
There's a raven flies overhead, I clocked it at 8.15. I'll bet it's there tomorrow too. I'll film it for you tomorrow
I have about one hundred and fifty millilitres of water left. That's four ounces. I can't believe it but I peed twice today, within a few minutes of each other. How is this possible? It's two days since I peed, I'm dehydrated and I had to go so quickly I forgot to save the first. I saved the second in the CamelBak. Will I drink it? It smells foul, and hot but it'll settle. And I can chill it in the sand in the night. It's like Polar winter here for nine hours.
No number twos. Which will disappoint my insect friends. They're gonna have to wait. The sunlight appears down here for a few hours. I get 15 minutes of it at 9.35... and apart from chipping away uselessly at this rock that's pretty much my morning routine.
I keep chipping at the rock but just to generate warmth and give me something to do. I think it's making it worse. I know it's settling more on my arm as I remove material from it. The area where I chipped flakes off yesterday has already rotated down onto my arm. PAUSE. I can't feel anything. PAUSE. So I made a great tourniquet and I tried to cut it off.

Oh yeah. That aches. He takes out the multi-tool and switches to the long blade. looks at it. Then he presses the blade and draws it quickly across his forearm. Nothing. Repeats it harder. Nothing. No cut, no blood, nothing. He switches to the short knife and saws viciously at the same point.
Shit! He releases the tourniquet and as the blood flow returns a series of angry red lines establish themselves where he was sawing. He looks at them.
Pathetic, Aron, pathetic.
The blades are too blunt even to break the skin. I guess that's the chipping. It's not even a proper Leatherman. It's a knock-off one we got free in a gift pack with a torch... Mom gave it to me.
I didn't get to hear firsthand how your championships went, but I heard from Mom that you placed very well at the national competitions, that you were tenth overall in speech and debate in the nation. Hot damn, girl. I'm very proud of you. Not just for that but for who you are. He looks directly in the lens for the first time.
I can imagine you in your living room looking back at me.
I've been thinking about what my friend Rob in Aspen says to me several... frequently.. Several times that, confusingly, 'It's not what you do but who you are'. I kind of got hung up on that a lot, because I always thought who I was, was very much wrapped up with what I did. That I was happy because of the things that I did that made me happy. If things you do make you happy, then they can also make you unhappy. I think that's why I found myself being as ambitious and energetic - The wind interrupts him and he shivers.
(mutters, bitterly) It's cold... this place is an ice- box at night... And killing winds.
(he struggles to complete the sense of the
I did want to say, on the logistical side of things, I have some American Express insurance that should cover costs of the recovery operation when that does happen. Bank account balances should take care of my credit-card debts. You'll have to sell my house, Mom and Dad. Possession- wise, I don't know if Sonja can use my computer and video camera...
No. No. Don't. He sees the moisture on the inside of the bag, condensation. He licks it with his sticky tongue, twice, three times. He looks back at the LCD screen.
See you later... ... swallows quickly 2 'spoons' of urine without disturbing the sediment. Tangy and bitter, the saltiness makes him wince.
(furious at himself) Fuck a nut, Aron. Pay fucking attention - look what you did? He stares at the stain - with all the dirt on his shorts it's already paste. He screws the lid on slowly and can barely be bothered to lift his lens into his mouth.
Good morning everyone! It's 6:45 Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The weather is great! I figure by now that Leona, my housemate - Hi Leona! - has missed me hopefully since I didn't show up last night. Another hour and a half they'll miss me for not showing up for work. Hi Brion at work! Best case scenario is they notify the police and after a 24 hour hold they file a report, a missing persons report. Which means noon tomorrow it's official that I'm gone. I do still have the tiniest bit of water left. Well, actually, I've resorted...I've had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that I saved in my Camelbak. I sorta let it distill...it tastes like hell. So it's 70 hours since I left on my bike from Horseshoe Trailhead during which time I have consumed 3 liters of water and a couple mouthfuls of piss. Pause. Did I say the weather is great? Well, it is. Though flash floods potential is still present. There's 4-prong major canyons upstream from me that all converge in this 3 foot wide gap where I am. The rock I pulled down on top of me, it was put there by flood.
Mom, Dad, I really love you guys. I wanted to take this time to say the times we've spent together have been awesome. I haven't appreciated you in my own heart the way I know I could. Mom, I love you. I wish I'd returned all of your calls, ever.
I really have lived this last year. I wish I had learned some lessons more astutely, more rapidly, than I did. I love you. I'll always be with you.
Ready for lift-off. He bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the haul line. It looks a better set up.
Come on, move, dammit. Nothing. He stops. And stares directly at the knife below him. Absolute stillness. Nothing moves. Not him. Not even the insects.
Whoa, that's the bone. He pulls the knife out opening the wound more. There's barely any blood. He pokes at the gash with the tool.
Ouch! He can see the epidermis, thick and leathery rough. Yellow fatty tissue under the skin in a membrane layer around the muscle. He thocks, thocks again and some blood finally seeps out and blocks his view. He pulls the knife out and thinks. He's sweating and puts the tool on top of the chockstone. He immediately pulls up his water bottle and stares into it. With a little shake he opens it and drinks it all gulping open throated. He shakes any last drop down and runs his tongue up into the neck. He screws the lid back on and loosens the tourniquet. There's no discernible increase in blood loss. He picks up the video again.
This next part may not be for all viewers at home. It's a little after eight. At precisely eight o'clock I took my last sip of clean water... and... hide your eyes, Mom... He pans across the boulder and zooms in on the wound, smattered with bright red blood.
I made an attempt - a short career in surgery, as it turned out - those knives are just not anywhere close to the task. I've got about an inch-wide gash in my arm that goes about a half inch deep. I cut down through the skin and the fatty tissue, and through some of the muscle. I think I cut a tendon, but I'm not sure. I'll never saw through the bones with this knife. I tried, anyways. It really just didn't go well. The tourniquet is relaxed at this point. Which actually is a little bothersome, considering I'm not bleeding that bad, barely at all. It's so weird. You'd expect to definitely see more pulsing and bleeding, but oh well.
Shit missed it. 8:31AM. He's late and I still missed it. We can hear his heart racing. He holds his left hand to it hoping to calm it down.
God, it's Aron again. I still need some help. It's getting bad here. I'm out of water and food. Listen. Give me the strength not to do anything against myself. I want to see this through, whatever. A rumbling thunderous sound grows and the inside of the bag begins to bear the image of the top of the canyon at dawn but crumpled like paper, creased like the bag [BUT STRETCHED ACROSS 2 SCREENS]. The noise grows and grows...
Out of date. May Day. Not dead. He smirks. 8:15 Waits for the raven. No sign
No raven today. Everything's fucked. Sonja... if you still want me to play at your wedding... there's a tape in a box in the basement of Mom and Dad's Lounge. It's me 1993 or 1994. We hear the music. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Chopin - he can hear it as he played it until...
There was a little boy,and he looked like my cousin Charlie but he was too young. And I don't want to die... But I really don't know what to do. Pause. Quietly, deadly:
I hate this rock. The rage blooms purple in his mind.
I hate it. His face swells with anger, nostrils flaring.
I hate this fucking canyon. A small mushroom cloud of pulverized grit and dust erupts each time.
I hate this cold slab pressing me against this damp fucking wall. Smash, Smash, Smash.
I know there's water near coz of these fucking mosquitoes. The sock quickly disintegrates with friction as he hammers and hammers.
I hate this fucking mess. Finally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid around the rock. He pulls them off with his teeth and the stone drops to his feet. There's a thick layer of dust across the top of the stone and his right arm. He tries to blow it away. He fails. Tired, it's too thick and he's too dehydrated. He picks up his knife and using this starts sweeping the grit off his thumb. As he cleans up he accidentally rips away a thin piece of decayed flesh. It peels back a long way like a skin of boiled milk. The insects start to gather.
Shit.
Ok Aron, here we go. You're in it now. He pushes the knife hard, to the hilt, in between 2 veins on his wrist. Fuck knows where the sweat is coming from but it's pouring out of him. Sawing downwards he makes as large a hole as he can without tearing any of the noodle like veins. He puts the knife in his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his right arm. Like a mechanic he looks to analyse and then he works by feel only. His sweat falls on his knife mixing with the blood. He pulls muscle nearer the surface allowing his knife to slice and pare away at a pinky 'finger-sized' fragment bit by bit. It takes a dozen actions, each time the knife goes back to his teeth. Sort. Pinch. Rotate. Slice. There's not a lot of blood. But he keeps working and working. Once the blood increases he puts the knife down on top of the rock and swiftly ties his tourniquet. He's silent, refusing to verbalize the pain.

(spitting out this declaration at the rock)


Hang in there Aron. At they get closer he summons a surge of energy from somewhere.
My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped by a boulder on Saturday and I've been without food and water for 5 days. I cut my arm off this morning to get free and I've lost a lot of blood. I need medical attention. There's a pause as they look at this refugee from a low budget horror movie. He hungrily eyes the water bottles attached to their waist bands. This gives them a way in to his world. The moment is broken by their offering him their water. It pours down his throat bypassing the swallow mechanism.
No, we need to keep hiking. We need a helicopter - who can run fastest?- You, go now fast. Take him. Monique runs ahead with Andy, her son.
Who? Who told you?
Do you have a phone?
Do you have a cell phone?
Is it ok for me to drink so much water?
I gotta stop and empty my shoes. You'll have to tie my shoe lace. As he sits his head slumps forward. He's absolutely motionless. Wayne and Erik try to talk to him but he can barely hear them. A pop song spins round and round distantly. He strains to pull his head up, and, staring, drops forward to his knees. There it is. Filling his vision like a god. Whirling screaming in front of him, dust blasting him as he kneels. A HELICOPTER.
Yes I am. Can I get a lift?
I'm gonna make a terrible mess of your seat.
Thank you for bringing me back. The most senior of the burly men says,
Will you look after this for me please? He opens his fist and there is the small folded up knife.
Mom.
Hey Mom.
OK. Are you okay...
Mom, I'm sorry I scared you. Very soft voice (again) - Aron hears the same words as he drifts back into drugged rest.
So are you guys ok with me?
Christine told me.
Yeah. She laughs at him.
I'm gonna finish the 49ers this winter or next.
Rana, before I did it I was hallucinating, I saw this child, a little blond boy -
No, he looked like my cousin Charlie but way too young... and I didn't know why but I knew he was mine and that this was what lay in front of me. He looks at her. Pause. She doesn't say anything.
But it's not going to be you, is it?

","











































































































































































































































","
Breathing hard, heart racing he listens again. The noise is still there unchanged. He knows now it's not people. They would have heard him.
He stops, staring at the camera still recording. He picks it up, rewinds and ...
You can see him thinking. Will the girls go to the party?
... snap back to Aron's face.
We see his sister on her living room sofa. The sofa sits in the open section of the canyon.
He's interrupted by a sudden realization as he looks first one way up the canyon and then the other. He looks up at the sky above.
Aron's sky darkens above him. Instantly plunging him into a dark, violet nether-light. He looks up the canyon as he pulls at his arm in panic and tries to gather his laid-out possessions into his backpack. Simultaneously he opens his mouth to gather any drops he can into his parched throat.
He folds open the knife, grasps it in his fist and picking a spot just above the rock's grip on his right wrist, he hesitates and then violently plunges the blade into his arm up to the hilt. He lets go leaving the knife embedded. He swoons and stares at it. He slowly grasps the tool more firmly and wriggles it slightly, the blade connects with something hard. He taps the knife down and feels it knocking on the radius of his upper forearm bone. He puts his ear close and we can hear the little thocking sound.
Stops the video and rips a section of his t-shirt to make an impromptu bandage to cover the wound. As he ties it with his teeth there's a rush of someone else's noise: the swat of wings. He grabs the camera just in time to catch the very end of the raven's flight 70 ft above his head.
Aron falls into the canyon.
It's strangely still even by the canyon's standards. He peeks out from his head bag; his contacts are cloudy and sore to blink. You can hear him blink. Eye socket rasping against eyeball. The head lolls like he's lost control of the neck muscles. His tongue rasps as he flexes his mouth to prevent sealing.
He looks at his obituary on the wall. ARON. OCT 75 => APR 03.
He looks at his 'good' hand. It's swollen and angry red like an inflated prosthetic on top and around of his real hand. He takes off his shoe and pulls the sock over his hand to cushion his palm and picks up the black rounded hammer rock again. Ignoring the pain he starts hammering at the rock surface. SMASH. MAD NOW.
He mutters...
He can't cut the tendon, no matter how hard he slices. But nothing will stop his addiction to surgery now. He folds in and swaps the blade for the pliers. He uses them to bite into an edge of the yellowy tendon. Then squeezing and twisting he tears away a fragment. Grip. Squeeze. Twist. Tear.
He returns to the knife. Finally all that remains inside is a pale white strand. Like swollen angel hair pasta. The nerve. He touches it with the knife edge.
He looks at it... the nerve.
...and the thin, swollen wire of his own nerve looks back at him. For the final time, he asks himself, `Can you do this?'
He puts the knife in and pulls it toward him, an inch, two inches, it lengthens like pulling a guitar string. Unimaginable pain builds in his whole body, like he's pushing his arm into a cauldron of magma...
He's busy packaging his stump in the plastic grocery sack and then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore as a chocker to keep his neck warm in the night. He stuffs the repackaged arm into the empty Camelbak backpack and throws the straps over his neck to hold the arm in a makeshift sling. Packs his bag, water reservoir, full bottle of shiny urine, video, pocket knife. Grabs his climbing rope, messy and knotted from its use as insulation, and heads off down the canyon. Stops almost immediately and hesitates for a beat. He returns
And now the motion and energy and life force of the action movie returns... It's like Ray Liotta's final day in Goodfellas; relentless, frustrating, pressure of life again now he's free from his tomb. Deeper and deeper, down and down into the swirling scoops of the sandstone. Couple of difficult manoeuvres, lots of slipping and bumping, despite his best effort occasionally his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops, winces and grunts thru the pain. But on he goes, 100 ft of the rope trailing behind him. As we follow its progress snaking after him we see specs of blood on the lower walls. The canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep in which he ignores the shrinking daylight above because he has another target; the twists and turns of the curricles of sedimented sandstone lead to a soft glow, red, translucent, growing and growing in intensity. He pushes forward, the tail of rope whipping faster and faster along the walls and floor.
","OK - lights off and line up alongside me. They turn off their vehicles' headlights as she draws a long line in the sand and they join her standing on one side of it.
On the other side of this line, everything will be different. As they all hold hands and together step cross the line (Aron's keen and ever so slightly ahead of everyone across the line) the sparkling lights of the crescent-shaped `town' of vehicles and camps that is Burning Man are replaced by an astonishing sunrise in the Nevada desert. They hoot and holler as Rana smiles beautifully at Aron.
And remember, stick together, the desert wants to kill you.
OK - he's got 3 vegetarian hotdogs and the tickets and he'll be outside Gate 6 in 5.
Yeah. We split up a while back when you were in hospital.
(always to the point) Is that what this is about?
What about the climbing? Aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking prosthetic arm / axe. He clinks the points together. She doesn't laugh, maybe a smile.
Solo?
(to change it) Well, all I can't figure out is what took you so long to cut it off and get one of these. They both laugh. But he also answers.
(over her glasses) Not Jesus please...
No Aron, it's not.
You know, everyone who cares for you, a little bit of them dies each time you go back. Before he can work out how to answer she breaks the door open.
Let's go hero. If they do The Fly first and we miss it we'll never be forgiven.
","(looking at Megan) Sure, I'm Kristi.
It's beautiful.
We left the car there. Pretty quiet.
... and suddenly there's a guy right behind you and `wait a minute, why is he wearing a HOCKEY
The Cathedral? We've got a bit disorientated and the map isn't great. Where is it?

Of course he's ok. Listen to him. Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish song at the top of his voice. Kristi strips to her underwear and traverses away from Megan.
Got to be there, Meg.
So have you got a girlfriend, Aron?
There's always a girl, you just don't know it yet.
With lots of characters in it.
... you can be the highest person on the continent!
Why are you on your own?
Not those guys from...
Well, we'll sign your time-card today.
Okay but don't look and no grabbing now, if I do...
Shhh! Aron then quickly slips to the bottom. Megan is way high, Kristi half way.
How far is it? He shows them on the map.
Yeah, we'd like that. What time?
Come on Aron, hike out with us - we'll go get your truck, hang out and have a beer.
Okay. Scooby Doo, yeah?
