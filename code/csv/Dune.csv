,JESSICA,--,PAUL,REVEREND MOTHER,DUKE LETO
txt,"(inner voice) I know she has come to test him... no man has ever been tested with the box... only Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son. The doors open, she meets the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (the Emperor's truthsayer) and takes her back toward the Castle. The rain rushes loudly into the storm drains.
Paul?... This is very important... Jessica leaves, closing the door behind her. Paul sits up in bed.
It meant so much to him...
I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll pay for my own mistakes.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... (to Reverend Mother) Please...
Your Reverence.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you. Jessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training which permits an adept to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice. It sounds as if two people are talking -- one normal and the other gutteral and slightly electronic. The effect is strange, yet subtle.
Paul! She tries to hold him.
(turning away) (inner voice) I must not fear. Fear is the mind- killer... the little death that brings total obliteration... The door of the spaceship closes.
So many reminders of the scarcity of water.
The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know you had so much reason to hate them.
(inner voice; noticing Yueh's hands) He's hiding something -- holding something back. (She studies his face closely.) It's not just his wife... He's a good man though. He's probably trying to save my feelings... (We see her mouth.) I could use The Voice... make him tell me... It would only shame him. (We see her eyes.) I must place more trust in my friends. (We see Yueh turn toward her, fearful.)
(inner voice) I must speak with you Leto!
(staring at the blue-eyed woman -- waiting for possible danger.) Yes?
You may refer to me as ""my lady."" I am not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto -- mother of the heir designate.... ""Shadout""... that's an ancient word.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
(inner voice) That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. (out loud) I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin. Mapes takes a step backward to flee.
I know many things. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.
And the means of my death should I prove otherwise. (inner voice) Now we will see which way the decision tips. Slowly Mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a sheathed knife. She unleashes it.
(inner voice) It could only be one thing.... (out loud) It's a crysknife.
(inner voice) Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. (out loud) It's a maker... Mapes SCREAMS with elation and grief.
(inner voice) Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... (out loud) Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
(inner voice) I must speak with you Leto!91. Through 92. (Deleted)
(inner voice) Leto... where are you?
(inner voice) Yueh's sign. He's left a satchell. Jessica and Paul, bound by cabin straps, lie in the back, the two guards at the controls. Outside, `thopters and ships fly past them toward the city. The distant FIRES play over Jessica's face as she sees Yueh's triangular tattoo scratched in the cabin roof.
(inner voice) Oh great mother! He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
(inner voice) The calming exercise.
(inner voice) Excellent! Guard #1 finds himself removing Jessica's gag. Guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems powerless to stop him. Once, it's off Jessica smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter floor.
(The Voice) There's no need to fight over me. The two men stare at one another a moment. Then Guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into Guard #2's chest, killing him. Guard #1 pulls the knife out, smiling. The ornithopter begins to veer off into a dangerous nose dive.
(The Voice) First cut my son's bonds.
(The Voice) That's it. The blade cuts through the strap holding Paul's legs. Paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out the man's mouth. Paul grabs the controls but it's too late. The ship falls into the rock.
Oh, my God!131. through 131A. (Deleted)
Leto! Leto! Tears course down her cheeks as Paul turns to her.
(to Paul) Leto! He's dead! He's dead...
Where are we do you think?
Bring these satchels! She hands him one.
(starting to cry) A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
(inner voice) Is he....?
(inner voice) He knows.
(inner voice)(as Paul leaves to light the thumper) ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...149. through 151. (Deleted)
(puts in her noseplug) I'm ready. Paul and Jessica move into camera and exit right.
I can't... I can't. She turns to see. Then she runs.
Yes...
Paul! She presses against the narrow ledge that is left after the worm assault.
(whispering) Man-carved steps.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Then I will teach you our way of battle.... you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Moisture... She looks at Paul. He, too, notices.
(inner voice) They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen. (out loud) I will try to pass within.
(inner voice) I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
(inner voice) The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic. I must transform the poison configuration within my body... the blue must be made clean. She swallows. Her body contorts and spasms violently. She screams. The Reverend Mother screams with her.
What is this?... Is this what kills the men who enter here? She quickly takes the fetus back up the tunnel. As they move:
Alia. As they lift Alia for Jessica to see...
It's the way she speaks of things... Alia is listening - then exits.
Alia!226A. (Deleted)
(struggling) Alia! What is it?
Stop him yourself.
Think on it Chani... We who carry the name of concubine... history will call us wives. Alia enters with two monks. She signals and one of them places a cloak over Paul's shoulders.
","The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the Prophecy, but we do not hear it. The huge wind organ BLOWS louder and louder, obscuring her voice. The picture FADES.
The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother.
The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.

28A. (Deleted)
The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
42A. Through 45. (Deleted)
The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS. Suddenly the Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet in the air. It is a frightening sight. He floats down under the giant, humming electrical tube light and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink glow. Feyd and Rabban watch nervously. The Attendants stand completely still with fear. The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands petrified. The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as they step slightly backwards. The boy begins SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug, located in his chest. The violet flowers are bumped and disarrayed by the violence which ensues. Then the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS continue to roar.52A. through 52B. (Deleted)
58. through 60. (Deleted)
The engineers activate a series of atometric Holtzman generators. Suddenly SOUNDS begin. The machines start; at first low, then they WHINE upwards to a high pitch. When the pitch is steady, a series of levers are pulled.

Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
125. (Deleted)
Guard #1 slowly cuts Paul's big straps, never taking his eyes off Jessica. The ornithopter gets closer and closer to the top jagged surface of the Shield Wall.
Paul moves off into the shadows. Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe. Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move. He races up a rocky incline.

Jessica spews water into the spout. The monk swirls the jug, sniffs at the spout and then drinks.
204. through 209. (Deleted)
Stilgar signals, and Fremen run behind them.

In the hollow of a huge dune, Paul stops with Chani. They share a look into each other's eyes. Paul turns towards the Fedaykin and nods. They move in quickly to tie and wrap Paul in Fremen rope. They move back and wait quietly. Chani moves in very close to Paul. She holds a glass vial of the blue water of life.
254. (Deleted)
Gurney and Stilgar don't understand. Suddenly enormous dust clouds and LIGHTNING sweep up over the Shield Wall.
270A. through 271. (Deleted)
We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING. Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator.
A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the prophecy.
This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd moves away effortlessly. Feyd counters and kicks Paul to the ground.
","(whispering) Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond...
(whispering again) It does look dry....
Where are the Harkonnens from here?
(without turning) I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back to the door. Hawat suppresses a smile.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
I'd know the difference. Paul rises and turns to face them.
My father sent you to test me. Music then? Thufir scowls.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry Gurney.
(inner voice) What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
(strange shielded voice) Is this what you seek?
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Things have been so serious here lately.
Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis?
Only?! They smile at each other.
The storms and the worms. Is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour?
Well, how do the Fremen survive there?
(smiling) The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways?
(rising) The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.
I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going?
The bull that killed my grandfather... is this an evil omen? Suddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant black head.
(happily) Duncan!
Why? I wish you were coming with us.
May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.
(diffident) Father.
I want you to be proud of me. Paul smiles up at his father. The WIND blows the Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the green and black Atreides banner against the night sky beyond. The RAIN starts again -- lightly. Paul takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in the wind.
(whispering again) Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet... moving... moving. CU Paul's face. Paul's eyes snap open. He hears footsteps outside his door. As the door opens he closes his eyes, however, and he pretends to be asleep. Jessica and the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway looking at him.
Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father... nothing?
(inner voice) What does she fear? (out loud) What about my Father?
(inner voice) She's using The Voice. (out loud) No. She sees him struggling.
(inner voice) The Voice again.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
(whispering) It burns.
(inner voice)(struggling to compose himself) I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
(cannot help the explosion)
I see the truth of it.
I know it. Suddenly the Reverend Mother holds her hand against Paul's head. She closes her eyes.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
What is it?
Where?
I have heard of it.
Did they try and fail?
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
MOTHER! Tell me! The Reverend Mother covers herself and moves quickly to the door.
(inner voice) Far off in the control rooms.... Travelling without moving. They wait.56. (Deleted)
(inner voice) Spice... As he continues eating he notices the sunlight through the slates over the window begins to GLOW white hot. Paul's eyes are intense as the light GLOWS brilliantly.
(whispering inner voice) Terrible purpose.... What is it?
A Fremen... Could she be the operator? No...
(inner voice) A traitor... Before he can speak the Shadout Mapes is gone -- running off down the passageway. Jessica enters.
(looks to Jessica) There is a traitor among us.80A. (Deleted)
Are you a Fremen?
(inner voice) He's hiding something.
""Your gift is a blessing of the river."" Kynes' FREMEN GUARDS, hearing this are siezed with agitation. Kynes QUIETS them, then studies Paul.
No.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Will we see a worm?
Always?
Why do they come?
(inner voice as a blinding light comes and goes) Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
(inner voice) Liet?
(struggling painfully) Father!... father... drugged...
(seeing Duncan) Duncan!! Duncan!! Paul and Jessica are carried off, quickly, through the darkness. The battle SOUNDS thundering.
(struggling to use The Voice) Don't touch my mother...
(using The Voice) Remove her gag!
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock. Maybe that small rock.
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area. We must make it to that rock...
Hurry! He jumps out of his seat.
(at doorway) Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm. As Paul puts the satchel over his shoulder, he feels something. He looks at his father's ring. He stares at it silently, then closes his hand around it. They jump outside.
(inner voice)(reacting to his mother's tears) Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?...
The spice! It's in everything here. The air, the soil, the food... It's like the Truthsayer drug..... It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me. But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness. I can see it... I can see it.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach... I'm something different, something unexpected! (inner voice) I'm a seed. (out load) I am so much more... You don't begin to know me...141. through 142A. (Deleted)
(inner voice) Father... now I have become a killer and I will continue to kill until I have avenged your death. (out loud) Father! Jessica cries as she stares at her son.143. through 143A. (Deleted)
(inner voice) Yueh's left the plans for the weirding modules.
We have to get to that mountain of rock. We have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our lives... Jessica gets up. They make their way up the crest of a dune by a small rock.
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come.... I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it.
(returning) Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Keep going...
Faster!!
(screaming) Run!
Drum sand! The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground. Jessica falls. Paul stops and drags her up. They run again. The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud. Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone. Finally they find rock. Behind them the SOUND of the worm changes. They turn.
(inner voice) Cinnamon... the spice! (out loud) Do you smell it?
(inner voice) I know the secret. The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.157. (Deleted)
(inner voice) A thumper.161A. (Deleted)
(breathing heavily) Someone started another thumper.... We're not alone. They climb upwards until the ledge ends at the mouth of a dark crevice. Paul and Jessica try to see into the inky black hole.
(whispering) Yes... They climb the steps and enter an extremely narrow dark channel of stone. As they make their way through the rock, suddenly there is a burst of lightning which illuminates a whole troop of Fremen standing silently in front of them.
(inner voice) From my dream... so beautiful. Liet.... is this Kynes' daughter? Paul stares at her in wonder.
(thinking) What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Wind traps... huge ones. Down a long, sloping, narrow passageway they go until they reach a stairway cut into the stone. It is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they descend. The WIND sound grows. The air grows colder and damper. Paul and Jessica share another questioning look. At the bottom of the stairs they pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly opens out on something so totally unexpected it shocks Paul.
(inner voice) Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream. (out loud) A treasure.
(inner voice) I am only a seed. (out loud) I am Usul... Paul Muad'dib.
(inner voice) No one ever dreamed there would be so many. (out loud) Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once again in control of Arrakis. Stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to crush the Harkonnens. We must do more than this. We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis. The Guild and the entire universe depends on spice. ""He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing"". I will take one hundred of your warriors and train them. This one hundred will train the thousands that remain. When the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to Arrakis. The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us. Arrakis will become the center of the Universe. (inner voice) The dream unfolds.181. through 181A. (Deleted)
The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit secret. With my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it.
Move back! Paul also moves back. He switches on his weirding module. He opens his mouth and makes a small SOUND, which the module amplifies.
Chuksa! The sound shatters the obelisk to pieces. The one hundred Fremen YELL with surprise and awe.
(inner voice) To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines. Stilgar turns to Jessica.
(inner voice) The most lethal poison in the Universe. Then we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation with the Reverend Mother:
Did they try and fail?
(inner voice)(turning to his mother) What if she should fail? He brings the jug close to Jessica.
(inner voice) She did it!
Chani.... I love you... I've always loved you....
Activate your weirding modules... Paul activates his, and the Fremens follow suit.
Set the range for two meters. Paul walks down the line of Fremen.
Korba... (points to robot) The arm...
Motion... Chuuk-sa...
(inner voice) My own name is a killing word. Will it be a healing word as well?
Now!
(his V.O. from the past) When the spice flow stops, the entire Universe will turn to Arrakis. The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
(inner voice) Only the very strong ones travel this deep.... The SOUND and VIBRATIONS continue to build. In the distance, the Fedaykin and Stilgar watch.
(inner voice) A sandrider!... Paul works the hooks into the breathing holes along the body...
(yelling) Long live the fighters! They return the traditional CALL and Paul steers the maker in a giant circle. They head out across the dunes.219G. (Deleted)
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Gurney!... The figure stops -- stunned.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Hurry! All I see is darkness.
(inner voice) Now... the test of the water of life... what is it that waits for me in this darkness?
Father!... Father! THE SLEEPER HAS
Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet. A quiet, haunting MOAN of recognition of a master rises from the Fremen.
(loud) Your time has come. (inner voice) Father... our time has come. (out loud again) A storm is coming -- our storm... and when it comes it will shake the Universe. Emperor... we come for you. A thunderous ROAR arises. War DRUMS pound. The ORGAN blows hurricaine of power through the sietch.
(he raises crysknife) Long live the fighters!
Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the atomics. I want an opening through the entire Shield Wall. Stilgar? Do we have wormsign? Stilgar and Gurney laugh.
(laughs)(to Gurney and Stilgar) Alia keeps pace with the storm.
Gurney, now! Gurney gives a hand signal and...
Let him stand free! The Emperor turns nervously to Feyd, who passes a golden dagger to Thufir.
(inner voice) A knife.... (out loud) In payment of the many years of service to my family, you may know ask of me anything you wish. Anything at all. (quietly) Do you need my life, old friend? He turns his back on him.
(quiet) It is yours. Thufir's eyes grow sad and wide.
I mean this, Thufir. If you are to strike, do it now. Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing motion. Paul turns and catches him as he sags. His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul urgently.
(to the guards) Carry this noble Atreides warrior away. Do him all honor. The guards do as they are instructed.
Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad.... SEND THEM
(to the Guildsmen) Good. You have some idea of what I would do but I will tell it to one who has never been seen... one who hides deep in the Heighliner control rooms. He will hear it first.
Don't try your powers on me. Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required. Here I stand. But... I will never be yours.
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning. In time you perverted the truth. You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan. How little you understand.
(using The Voice)
I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine. I can kill with a word.
(to Emperor) There is a Harkonnen among you. Give the Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.
The Emperor's blade. Feyd takes up the Emperor's blade with a smile. Paul takes out his crysknife. They begin to circle each other. Paul smiles, circling still. Suddenly, Feyd leaps, his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily evades it, moving away. They begin to circle again. He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on his face.
Now, I will tell you how it will be. Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.
(to Chani) The Princess shall have no more of me than my name... no child of mine or touch the softness of glance... nor instant of desire.... This is my promise to you... (whispering) ...my love. Paul turns back to the others. Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her.
The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib. They will have their Holy War to cleanse the Universe... they will have Arrakis... Dune... their planet. There will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases. For the spice there will always be some desert. There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. We Fremen have a saying... (he stares at the Reverend Mother) ""God created Arrakis to train the faithful."" One cannot go against the word of God. Everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly.
","We felt his presence.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord... (sensing something outside the room) He is here, my lord. Under the carved inscription ""Law is the Ultimate Science"", the doors to the Emperor's chambers slide open and FIFTY GUILDSMEN wheel in a forty-foot long giant black box. One of the Guildsmen addresses the Emperor through a translating device.
Yes, my Lord.
We'll salvage what we can... but I can tell you.. dear God... for the father... nothing. Jessica turns to the Reverend Mother, stunned! She turns back to look at Paul. Her hands tremble.
Did you really think that you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you!
My greatest student... and my greatest disappointment.... He's awake!... He's listening to us. (considering) Good... Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides... I want to see you in your mother's chamber in one quarter of an hour. She turns and walks away. Jessica remains at the door and calls out to Paul in the darkness.
You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son?... Desires don't figure in this! An Atreides daughter could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We may lose both blood lines now.
And your son will pay with you.
(using The Voice) Now you come here. Paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he fights her controlling him.
(inner voice) Some strength there. Surprising! (out loud) Come here. The Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube.
See this... Put your right hand in the box. Paul stares at the hole in the box.
Pain. Just then, she raises one hand to his neck. Paul sees a glint of metal. He tries to back away.
(The Voice) STOP! Put your hand in the box. Paul's hand goes in. Fear passes over his face.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
You feel the flesh crisping?
Flesh dropping off.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it! Paul pulls his hand out of the box. No sign of anything wrong. He turns his hand, flexes his fingers. He looks to the Reverend Mother.
(explaining) Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
(profoundly) The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
They tried and died.... (she calls out loudly) Jessica! Jessica enters immediately and sees with great relief that Paul is still active.
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
What can be done has been done.
... Many men have tried.
They tried and died.
(struggling, speaking) Kill this child!! She's an abomination!! Kill her. (points to Alia, who is smiling at her) Get out of my mind!!!
(strained speech void of emotion) Sister of Paul Muad'dib. The Reverend Mother slumps. The Baron's mouth flies open. The Emperor's face goes pale, his lips tremble.
Stop him, Jessica!
You mustn't speak of...
","Thank you for joining me, Paul. (voice tired) It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us.
(inner voice) My son. (out loud) Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations.... He swears you are the finest student he's ever taught. Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same.... It makes me feel very proud...
(studying the dark sea below) I'll miss the sea... but a person needs new experiences... they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow. Without change, something sleeps inside us... and seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken. Paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he sees the Duke's signet ring. Again he smiles at his father.
Soon they'll begin to fold space.
(on phone) Thufir?... anything?... keep looking. (Inner voice) ...and a traitor... God help us.
(very angry) The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives have already been taken. We must crush the Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all know what to do. (Turning towards Gurney) ...Gurney! We desperately need more spice miners... many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle. We need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men ... any with open sand experience. You must persuade them to enlist with us.
(squints at Gurney) Very moving, Gurney. On your way... and take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I arrive. We will not be prisoners here in this place.
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
This is my son, Paul.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
It's all right Gurney. Gurney steps back.
My thanks.
Wormsign? Is it wormsign?
What happens now?
Damn it... Harkonnens. He punches a control button and grabs a microphone.
(into microphone) We are coming down to take you off the harvester... All spotters are ordered to comply.
How many men do you have?
Damn the spice! Get out of there.
(yelling at the men) Two men in each of the spotters... You!... over here... run!! The ground is really shaking now. A tremendous low THUNDERING sound grows along with a high rasping
(yelling) What's that you're saying?
