txt,"...or they destroy you.From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the youngman from the opening) finishes reading from a paperMANUSCRIPT in his hand.
You can't show this to anyone.We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: aeighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. Butdetermined.Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of thebars.
You weren't even there. It's your truth. It's fiction.Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it outof reach.
You wanted him gone too. You sent him to me.Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper.Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the twoboys, two wills. Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip andwins. Lucien, panicking.
Please. You'll kill me with that.Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison.Desperate, Lucien calls out after him.
Allen! No!Allen doesn't turn. An alarm HAMMERS through the prison.
Allen! No! DON'T...!
(reciting) On a Sunday afternoon, when the shutters are down and the proletariat possesses the street...The tour guide looks around confused.
...there are certain thoroughfares which remind one of nothing less...Lucien gets on his knees and THRUSTS a lamp between his legs.
...than a big cancerous cock.Parents look around in shock. A female student is instantlyaroused. The prim PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN clomps over.
Henry Miller.
Which is why I committed it to memory.
Alert the press! Tell them Lucien Carr is innocent!Lucien flees, rushes out of the library.
Finally. An oasis in this wasteland.Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation.
Only the most anti-social have to go to an event actually called one. Libation?Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock.Allen looks nervously towards the door.
How does a horrible bottle of Chianti sound?Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. Allen stares. Hedoesn't break the rules.
Freshman?
Excellent. I love first times. I want my whole life to be composed of them. Life is only interesting if life is wide.
To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard.Allen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference asLucien knocks his wine back in one gulp.
How's your Yeats? Have you read A Vision?He tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling.
It's completely brilliant and impossible. He says life is round: we're stuck on this wheel. Living. And dying.Allen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees astrange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL.
An endless circle. Until. Someone breaks it. You came in here, you rupture the pattern. Bang: the whole world...
How did you...?
Are you a writer? Because I've got a job for a writer.Allen, mesmerized.
Well, you're not anything yet.This boy so close, the rush of contact. From down the hall...
Isn't that you?
No. Downtown.
Coming?
Welcome to the edge of the world.The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAPfrom Allen's dorm room which comes to life.A RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University allthe way...to Greenwich Village.
Allen in Wonderland.Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses herpassionately. Then lets her go, keeps walking.
No, and I don't plan on it. She tasted like imported sophistication and domestic cigarettes.
(calling out) Dave! Where's the liquor?! I'll be right back.As Lucien walks off, Allen tries to make himselfinconspicuous and sits down on the tub.
Allen, Willy. Willy, Allen, Lucien reefer.Lucien takes the joint.Bill puts the tube of gas back in his mouth, back tobusiness. Lucien grabs Allen's hand, pulls him to the party.
He wishes he were a criminal. The Burroughs family is richer than God.
He's a Harvard man, and he's going to be an amazing artist. His current medium is himself.Allen spots the TERM PAPER in Lucien's hand.
Bunk for school. Now, come on, I want you to meet our host.
Because it was me. First.David sees the boys talking. He eyes Allen, curiously.
(whispered, to Allen) He said he was my guardian angel, but that I was too much work.David crosses through crowd towards Allen.
Actually I invited him.
Some earjob at the bar just called me ""boy."" So I stole his drink.Allen scans, sees the famous poet OGDEN NASH looking aroundfor his glass.
Who's Ogden Nash?
And that's what he's selling?! I'll kill him.Bill takes out a switchblade.
No. We're not going to kill him. Even better. We're going make sure nobody remembers him. (turns to Allen) How many men started the Renaissance?
And the Romantics.
We're sending millions to fight the Fascists in Europe, but they're here! Meter and rhyme---
Yes! They're all guards in some prison. Let's make the prisoners come out and play. Let's come up with new words, new rhythms.Allen, swept up in the energy. He couldn't be morecaptivated.
We need a name.
Shit. So that's been done.
Ginsy, you're hired!Allen smiles a mile wide. He's in.Suddenly, the jazz singer stops. The band puts down theirinstruments. POLICEMEN escort a businessman and anothergentleman out of the bathroom, in HANDCUFFS. The mood in thebar chills.
""In the dawn, armed with a burning patience, we shall enter the splendid city!""Allen sits up.
It's Rimbaud. It's overwritten, I know. He's allowed.
What is?Allen stands, gathers himself urgently. He needs to besomewhere about twelve hours ago.
Don't go then.
What?
Perfect. I love complicated.
At least you have her. My father left me when I was four.A beat of understanding between them. Lucien lays down. Allentakes his cigarette, lays next to him.
So what do you suggest?
Where's the verve? The brio?!From atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with hisfoot. Grand classical music screeches to a start.
If it be that I am indulging my self-consciousness in justifying myself, or if it be--
Don't edit me!Lucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noosesnaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. Hestruggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair.The pipe starts to bend.Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room,suspended in air.The pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground.A beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break outinto hysterics.
The expression of self.
Then what do you suggest?
Institutions.
My father.Bill smiles. They're playing his game.
It's how we make the world wider.Allen considers, agrees.
Well, thank you.
Watch this.Lucien leans over a young woman, a statue at a table with ayoung man in military attire.
(whispered in her ear) Go.The girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to asecond, more attractive soldier. And kisses him. The pairerupt into life, into desire.Lucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozenmusicians. Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE.Wraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade.He pulls the knife free. Allen winces in pain.Lucien does the same to his own palm, then presses their twobloody hands together. A ceremony. Allen's eyes roll back.David appears in a janitor uniform. The Technicolor fades.
David, don't touch anything. We have to write it all down.Bill stands up, woozy. Calls out to David.
You make me too smart, they're gonna suspect something's up.David throws Lucien's coat over his shoulder.
Fuck you.David spots Allen watching from the bathroom.
""The rose that scents the summer air/ grows from my beloved's hair...?""
We have the map. We have the manifesto. We need the work. (suddenly cold) I was wrong. Maybe you're not up for this after all.
Stop!Allen grabs the pages Lucien has been working on: they arecovered in doodles - there's nothing there.
It's complicated.
He's a professor working as a janitor so he can be near his precious Lu-Lu. He is a goddamn fruit who won't let me go.
A queer.This detonates inside Allen. Lucien crashes to his bed. Allensits beside.
Right now, I just need you to write us something beautiful. (beat) First thought, best thought.
Allen in Wonderland.Is it something? He writes the words down. Flash of theirpast build in a crescendo as he keeps searching, diggingthrough moments, leading to...
What are you, moving in?
I found a real writer. Already a million words under his belt before Columbia.
What am I supposed to do? Newsreels?He spots the piece of paper in Allen's hand.
What's that?Defensive, Allen pockets his poem for Lucien.
If you're going to stay, don't hog the blanket.Lucien closes his eyes. Allen sits up, jealous, his mindspinning. He stares at Lucien.
Once you meet him, you'll see what I mean.
What do you think? Brilliant, no?
It's better than anything you've ever written.
Who's Sammy?
It's all true. Jack served in the Merchant Marines.
You two did just fight.
Lu, I don't think he gets what we're trying to do.
First thought, best thought.
You wrote that?
Forget Columbia. Forget Ogden Nash. Here's the plan, boys. We join the Merchant Marines. Sail the world until the war ends. Then jump ship and make it to Paris. For the liberation.
Jack does. It'll be us, together. At the beginning. It'll be the perfect day.A FLOOD-LAMP and HORN shatter the reverie.A COAST GUARD patrol boat has caught them. A megaphonesquawks to life.
Same reason you're here.
Loose Barnard girls.Marion Carr looks at the Dean with a weary smile.
(to Marion) You told him?!
Who said anybody could know anything about anything?!
You know me now. I'm only good at beginnings.
Best of luck.Allen GRABS Lucien's suitcase and sits beside Lucien. Thisexplodes out of him.
Why?
Damn! Shift's over.Jack looks back, shrugs as he walks off with the first page.Lucien groans, plan's 86'd. But Allen sits up.
Shit!
(deadly serious) No. Not yet, we have to finish.A FLASHLIGHT finds them. Allen and Lucien, caught. The guardspull out BILLY CLUBS.
Get off of me! Allen! Help!
To literacy.Allen, Bill, Jack and Lucien throw back their drinks incelebration.The Mills Brothers ""You Always Hurt The One You Love"" on thejukebox plays over this lazy, drunken afternoon.Allen's eyes scan the wall above them, Columbia's ""Hall ofFame"": newspaper headlines, yearbook photos...
Look at them!And we do: we see FLASHES of the photos: ribbon-cuttings,team-photos, graduations: life in a thousand fake smiles andstagings.
Souvenir history. To make people think they left some mark on the world. Because otherwise nobody would ever know. (beat) I don't ever want to end up on this wall.
Yup. And he says we should all have another round...Lucien stands up to get a drink. David grabs his arm. Lucientries to push him off.
I haven't seen you for days.David throws down Lucien's cravat to the table. The one weremember him wearing when we first met him in the library. Aprivate power move.
You wanted me to get kicked out?! You ratted on me!
Best of luck, Janitor.
We are over. Leave.Lucien spindles the paper and plunges it into a beer. Davidin shock, begins to shatter in front of them.
You'd be boring if it weren't for me!The two start to crack up together.
Jack? Jack? (no response) He broke his fucking neck. The warrior poet has passed on.Jack staggers from out of the barrel. Throws his hands in theair victoriously. Allen and Lucien cheer him on.
Excellent! Judges award a...Allen holds up nine fingers.
All right Ginsy, your turn.Drunk, Allen tries to stand up. But then falls right backdown. Lucien laughs, tucks his body next to Allen's.
This is just the beginning, you know.Lucien lays his head against Allen's shoulder.
Your fault, Ginsy. It's all your fault.Lucien's thigh brushes against Allen's.Allen stares at Lucien, in the full glare of Lucien's warmth.Allen looks around. The park is empty. Building up thecourage.
Let's go, Jack.
No. Allen's got work to do. Ten pages on Spengler's Decline of the West. Due tomorrow.
I'd be lost without you, Ginsy. (to Jack) Come on, Lion.The two of them leave. Allen, abandoned and broken, puts hishead in his hands.
(exiting) Lu's going to use the loo.
I'm going back to bed. Another word and I call the police.Lucien turns around and leaves David alone at the sill. Frominside the living room, David hears a MEOW.He spots Jack's cat KIT KAT looking up at him.
It was David.
I have another idea.
Sailing out. To Paris.Lucien grabs his BOY-SCOUT KNIFE. Puts it in his pocket.Allen is speechless.
We've got to make a ship, probably as merchant seamen. Jack knows the tricks.
We both know why you can't come.Silence. Lucien continues his packing. Allen breaks down.
No, you got what you wanted. You were ordinary, just like every other freshman, and I made your life extraordinary. Go be you now, all by yourself. Leave me alone.Allen, now in tears, realizing the end is here.
(cold, deadened) Allen. Leave.Allen gathers himself, stumbles out the door. Leaving thefriendship behind.Alone, Lucien cracks, breaking down as he closes hissuitcase.
Two seamen, reporting for duty.Jack tries not to laugh, hands over his paperwork. Theofficer points to Lucien.
Arthur Rimbaud.Jack rolls his eyes. The officer hands the paperwork back.
Let's go get on the docket.
Let me handle this.Lucien holds Jack back, rushes up to David.
How did you know I would be here?!
The reason I'm leaving is you.It doesn't register. Desperate, David holds out the passes.
Come with me. We're taking a walk.
Allen, thank God.Allen's skeptical face makes Lucien change tactics.
He wanted to hurt me, I had no choice.
Listen. Somehow he found me at the Marine Hall.Allen looks away, realizing he is potentially complicit.
He said no matter where I went, he would follow. When I confronted him, he exploded. I had to defend myself. He wouldn't stop.
The D.A. is asking for my deposition. In writing.Allen shakes his head, there's no way he's going to do this.
(pleading) We both know I can't do it. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to be stuck in here for the rest of my life!Allen, still unsure. Lucien slides his hand down the barsuntil it touches Allen's. Pleads seductively.
Please don't leave me here.The BUZZER goes off. Visiting time is over. The prison guardheads towards the cell. Allen makes a fateful choice.
We're going to say it was an ""honor slaying"".Off Allen's confused face...
I was just a kid, you dragged me into your perverted mess!
You're pathetic.Lucien walks on, but David lunges for him. They struggle.Lucien throws David off, spins free from his grasp, pulls outhis Boy Scout knife from his pocket.The two men face each other.
When?
Or they destroy you.We have returned to the opening scene of the movie. Luciencrumples the paper in his hand.
You can't show this to anyone.Allen stares at Lucien defiantly through the bars.
You weren't even there. It's your truth. It's fiction.
You wanted him gone too. You sent him to me.Allen SNATCHES the manuscript -- it's a tug of war throughthe bars.
Please. You'll kill me with that.Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip. He heads towardsthe exit of the prison. Desperate, Lucien calls out afterhim.
Allen! No! DON'T!An alarm HAMMERS through the prison, sending us to...
","Then tell the truth, Lu.
Fine. Anything for me?
No.Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. Thena woman whimpering in pain. Allen, worried, looks off, dreadin his face. His father just sighs.
Mom?His mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personalitydisorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirtybathrobe. Her knuckles are bleeding.
Dad didn't do that. I nailed the windows. Because you're not right.Naomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger toher mouth.
You have to rest. Clear your head. Do you want to go back to Greystone?
Then listen to me.
Can he still hear me?A BRAHMS WALTZ plays.
I didn't want her to know. (beat) It was a dream anyway.Louis lights his own cigarette. Offers his son one. Hedeclines.
is what we give away.
Give, is. Assonance.
I got in.
I got into Columbia University!
Allen Ginsberg.
Professor Steeves, then how do you explain Whitman?No one interrupts Professor Steeves. Murmurs from around theclass. Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen.
He hated rhyme and meter. The whole point was untucking your shirt.Professor Steeves smiles to himself. There's one of themevery year.
Allen Ginsberg.
Because it's easier.The class titters. Professor Steeves hushes them.
I can't. You see how much I've got to do.
Brahms?Allen walks inside. Lucien looks up, surprised.
How come you're not at the social?
You drink in your room?!
I don't drink.
Yes.Lucien hands him his glass.
Never heard of it.
Consonance. Reiteration of themes.Lucien, intrigued, circles in close.
No. I'm not.
What?!
I'll be back.
Hello?
Where'd he go?
(whispered, to Lucien) You're going to the dance?
No, he's not here with me.Lucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down thestaircase. Allen, torn between his mother and this boy.
(into the phone) Listen, I'll come as soon as I can.
Yes. Ipromiseloveyoubye.Allen hangs up on his mother and races after Lucien.
Do you know her?!
Sorry. Are you all right?
What is that?
Oh no, thanks. I don't do...the cannabis.Bill eyes Allen, skeptically.
(whispered) Is he a criminal?
He looks like a criminal.
What's that?
(whispered) Sounds like you.
Allen.Bill walks in, knows what game his friend is playing.
Why don't you like me?
That's Ogden Nash!
The best selling poet in the country.
Two.
(Five?)Lucien's passion building.
And Professor Steeves---
How did they come up ""Dada""?
What about Yeats? How about the ""New Vision?""
Shit.
No, my mother. This is bad. This is very bad.
She's going to be furious.
You don't understand. I have to.
It's complicated.Lucien sees his friend scared. Moved, he links his arm withAllen's.
Dad, what's going on?
(to his father) You can't do this to her.Naomi recognizes her son.
I was out. With a friend.
No, you're not leaving.Naomi points an accusing finger at Louis.
Dad?!
Your best.
Get off!From deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and wecan see she knows that it's too late.
Complicated enough?
I've been thinking about what Yeats said. To be reborn, we have to die first.Allen hands him back the smoke. Lucien perks up.
I've spent my life making other people happy.We PULL BACK to see a noose around Allen's neck. A suicide isunderway.
It's time I find happiness the only way I see possible.
That's a run-on.
Proclaims the death of morality. And...
The true, uninhibited, uncensored expression of the self.
Paterson, New Jersey.
Really?
You are an extraordinary man.Lucien beams.
There's more life in those five pages than in the dozens of bad sonnets we've read in class.Steeves cocks his eye, stares down Allen. The first timeAllen has defied anyone. Ever.
Keep going. That's my sonnet for Steeves.Lucien flips through the journal, closes it, disappointed.
Show me your fucking map.
Oh right, you don't have anything because David's not here to write it for you!Lucien stands up, drunk. Furious.
I love complicated.Lucien steadies himself. Furious.
A fruit?
Then let's get rid of him.Lucien softens, leans against Allen. Passing out from theliquor.
Writing!
Lu! It's very rough but...David sits at Lucien's desk, writing. Allen stops short.David spies the pages in Allen's hand.
Where's Lu?
You're not allowed to be here.
Not anymore.A stand-off. David collects his jacket, approaches.
Where have you been?!Lucien starts getting undressed.
You mean Jack?Lucien fumbles.
Why didn't you tell me?
Nothing.Lucien gets into bed.
Why is Jack a real writer?
No.Lucien drinks wine beside. Jack ignores Allen, wings thepigskin right at him. Allen ducks. The ball SLAMS into apainting on the wall. It crashes onto Allen's head.
It's missing some periods and commas.
I use periods and commas.
Not exactly. It's...
(sarcastic) Then why don't you just ship out again?
Yeah.
Allen.
Fuck you. What does that even mean?!
Fuck your one million words.
You don't know me.
Be careful. You are not in wonderland I have heard the strange madness long growing in your soul. But you are fortunate.Lucien listens anew, realizing this poem is about him.
In your ignorance In your isolation, you who have suffered Find where love hides. Give. Share. Lose. Lest we die unbloomed.Just the sound of the water. Completely vulnerable, Allensits back down.
You asked me to. Remember?Lucien lights up. He comes forward, gathers his friendsclose: gawky, emotional Allen. Blustery, sensitive Jack.
You don't speak French.
Who's she?The woman, EDITH (early 30s, Jewish, shy), waves nervously.
What's she doing here?
(smirks) So that's why you locked mom up.Louis SLAPS his son.Lucien storms out of the Dean's office, followed by Marion,putting on her fur coat. Marion inspects her son's newaccomplice then races after her son. Louis motions to Lucien.
No. I stole the boat. And it was tremendous.
Where are you going?
You're dropping out?
My father shows up yesterday with some new woman. And in the middle of the Allen's-a-screw-up monologue, all of a sudden, I realize: I don't care. I've never not cared. So, I told them it was my idea. To steal the boat.
Because I don't want to be the person they think I am. I'm on academic probation. I could be kicked out. You can't leave. You started something and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next.Lucien, moved.
It's our turn. Let's show them what we can do.At the thought of payback, Lucien awakens. Allen grins.
You in?
I'll go.
Hi.Gwendolyn looks up. Allen is smiling nervously.
I wondered if you could help me.
I'm looking for a book.
It's called The Day Amanda Came.
But...I really need it. Gwendolyn looks around.
Working here must be a drag.
How strict?
Right. No.
There is no book. Take it off.
No.
I do.
Wait. Lucien.Allen turns and sees Lucien, still furiously working, booksunder his arm.Jack shakes his head, follows Bill and races out the door.Alone, Allen RUNS back to Lucien who is madly placing thebooks in the vitrines. He is a man possessed.
Lu that's enough. Come on! What's wrong with you?
Jack, that's you, isn't it?He sees a framed photo of Jack in a football play, mid-catch.
What's he doing here?David walks briskly over to Lucien.
Maybe he didn't want to see you.
How did you know it was us?
(to David, a guess) You told the guards we were there. No one else knew.David does not respond. Jack suddenly jolts up. Shoves Davidback.
Yeah. (to Lucien) Cut him off.Lucien gives David a fatal look.
No, he lives!
Nine!
First thought, best thought.He grazes his hand against Lucien's inner thigh. Lucien looksdown at Allen's hand curiously, then back at Allen.The decisive moment. Allen leans over. Kisses him. It buildsin passion.Lucien pulls back, unsure. Then returns the kiss. It buildsin passion.Everything Allen had hoped for, lensed into a moment.
Excuse me?
Fuck. Fuck!
Your paper and my apology.Allen hands Lucien the paper he wrote for him. But Luciendoesn't take it. Allen registers that he's packing.
Where are you going?
You weren't going to tell me?
Fuck you. You're a phony. You got me and Jack and Bill making your vision come true. All because you couldn't do it yourself.
You don't really mean that.
He left.
But?
Could I have a whiskey, please?
Lu?Allen races to him. The man turns and Allen's heart sinks. Itis a SAILOR, a distant echo of Lucien.The Sailor eyes Allen gently, seductively.Allen walks up to him.
Edie? Is Jack there?
Know what?
How could you?
You could have run. Called the police.Lucien looks Allen fiercely in the eye.
But how did Jack and Bill get roped into this?
I'll do it.Lucien, smiling. Leans in, whispers.
But he didn't have to go with him.
What happened in Chicago?Marion stops packing. Thinks. She settles on the bed, charmsAllen with a smile.
That's what he called David.She exhales, her face falls. Leans in threateningly.
And what did you tell them?Bill sees the box of morphine from his night with Norman. Hedecides to take it with him, hides it under a pile of shirts.
Did David do something Lu in Chicago?
I have to be. I'm helping him write his defense.Bill paces, then turns to face Allen.
No, Mom. That's not true.
Mom, stop.
I'm in over my head. Someone I know killed a man. And I don't know what to do. He wants my help. And I don't know if I should give it to him. I don't know if it's right. It's just a mess.
I can't, mom. He's my best friend.
Then tell the truth, Lu.
Allen Ginsberg.
But you finished it.The Dean loses his patience.
Fine.Allen stands, making his decision.
Consider me expelled.Allen reaches for his manuscript. The Dean SLIDES it out ofreach.
","What there is, darlings and demoiselles, is a circle. Life is round. Patterns, routines, a wheel of self-abuse. Margaret, don't even deny it.Allen turns to Lucien.
Until. The the disruption we long for, comes along and the circle is broken.
Take this unbloomed stalwart.
And you are?
Allen, who comes uninvited to my apartment.
None of us notice him. Look at him. Why would we bother?In his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes theentire party is scrutinizing, judging him.
So the pattern of our evening, our lives, holds. But under the right circumstances, even he might change the world.Jazz music sparks, PRE-LAP from where this party's goingnext. Lucien eyes Allen -- an idea forming.
So you just met Lucien in the lunch line and now he's all that you can see.
""Await the girl who fassinets.""
More than I suspect this theory accommodates.
A literary revolution without writing a word. Neat trick, Lu.
What the hell is this?
Dimly-lit, I am sure. What have you done to my apartment?Allen struggles to his feet, moaning. Lucien steps betweenDavid and their wall of clippings.
This is not your revolution, this is my life.
It's mine. Not everyone gets an allowance. (beat) Leave. Get out!Allen stumbles out of the room, scared. David approachesLucien.
I need to speak to you. Alone.
And get you sent back to your mother again? That would just be the end of you.
Ah. The ""Vision"" at last. Can I see?Allen hides them behind his back.
He's out. With a senior, some football player. A writer and handsome too. (beat) James? Jack. There it is. Jack.
That's odd since I'm the only thing keeping him here.
Piece of advice. You don't know Lu. As soon you think you do, he'll find someone else.David smirks, walks off leaving Allen alone with his pages.
Or maybe he already has.
Excuse me. I think I saw some light or movement in the library.The security guards FLASH their lights at the facade.
Since you didn't show up earlier, I just hoped to give you this.
I think he can speak for himself.
You've had plenty of time to celebrate. Your library hijink made the morning paper. I'm sure you're all very proud.Allen, Jack and Bill glance at each other suspiciously, thenat David.
Did he use that ""Bastille"" line? Cause I gave it to him.Allen, Jack and Bill look at Lucien, shocked.
You left this at my place.
Stop, Lu. You're losing control again. You know what comes next. I know what comes next.
Excuse me?
Look at me, Lu.Tears well in David's eyes. Lucien sits back down, ignoreshim. Bill stands up, tries to lead David away.
(from his wound, breaking) You said I was everything to you. You are everything to me. Everything to me. Do you hear me?David fractures. Utterly vulnerable. This is it: the realuninhibited, uncensored self.
Shut up, traitor.He turns sharply to Lucien saying loud enough so everyone canhear.
You'd be dead if it weren't for me!Lucien totally dead cold. Allen, unsure what David is talkingabout. David turns and rushes outside and Bill follows him.Alone with Allen and Jack, Lucien suddenly smiles as ifnothing just happened, puts his arm around Allen.
I know this is crazy. I don't know even know what I'm doing here. But I had to tell you I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you.From behind...
Allen, have you seen him? He's not in his room.They look almost the same.
I did something wrong. Really wrong. And you have no reason to help me. But
I know who you are. We're the ones he needs, but never wants. It hurts, doesn't it?Allen burns, does not respond. David is right.
All I am asking is tell me where he is. Please.CLOSE ON: Allen, on the blade of a choice.
Listen, I spoke to a guy upstairs. I got two passes. I packed for both of us. We can leave.
Then you and Jack take them. I'll catch up.Lucien considers this, then makes a fateful decision.
Let's get out of the city. Anywhere you want. I've saved up.
How can you say that? You know that's not true.Lucien stops short. Stares hard at David.
I will never give up on us.
Now I know how you felt.
When you wanted to die.David takes a step, closing the gap between him and theknife. Daring Lucien to strike.
Do it.Lucien moves forward. The gap narrows. Just inches away fromeach other.David steps forward onto the blade. Lucien does not back off.David gasps, notices the knife deep in his chest to the hilt.Blood pumps from the gash.Lucien frees the knife. Then pulls back and STABS David asecond time. With malice.And again. Plunges the blade into his chest. He grinds theknife into David even further..
Oh my god...David DROPS, clutching his shirt, his life pulsing from hischest.
","(through the mask) You're...pinching...Allen stands up, realizing his foot is on a snaking blacktube leading to a metal canister of gas.
(long exhale) Artifacts in the visual field, some light-headedness. Motor hyperactivity.
Nitrous oxide, for narcoanalysis. Know thyself. And beshit thyself. Ever done that?Allen shakes his head no. Bill turns off the gas. Offers ajoint to Allen.
Show me the man both sober and happy, and I'll show you the crinkled anus of a lying asshole.Allen raises an eyebrow. Lucien returns with a paper in hand.
Play nice, David.
Because David was in the same godforsaken line.David and Bill share a knowing look. Lucien returns to thetable and slams a glass down.
""A girl who is bespectacled. She may not get her nectacled. But safety pins and bassinets--""
Aim for the throat.A realization. Lucien leans in, focuses his charm.
Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a dictionary.
Well, I'm listening.
Words, boys. Empty words.
The derangement of the senses.
Bingo.The music suddenly stops as we ...
Time slows down as you drift deeper and deeper into your cave...Bill notices David, turns off the gas.
We are exploring the avenues of Allen's mind.David looks around the mess of his living room, his pillagedlibrary of books, papers all over the floor.
Get this man a pair of scissors!
What kind of life is it?
The Germans call it the ""wonder drug."" Prescribed for super-human feats.Norman pops open a briefcase full of drugs. Bill selects agreen pill bottle and gives it to Allen.
Sudden blindness, bouts of diarrhea, heart palpitations, and a severe decline in moral standards.
But the words, oh the words...
25 seconds. Masterful.But then, another page, GWENDOLYN (20, sweet and saucy),joins the first.
Go!Lucien races into the stacks after Allen.
Let's go.
Let's go. Time and place, David.
Contrary to reports, prison is not a tonic for the spirit.We are now realizing it's the end of a chapter for all ofthem.
All the district attorney cared about was if David was queer.Allen gulps. The heart of the issue, thrust into the light.
I said yes.
Christ Allen, please don't get involved.
David was my friend. But he's dead. And did Lucien tell you how he died?Allen shakes his head. He has no idea.
Leave him alone, Dad.
Yes, sir.
The libertine circle has come to an end.Allen looks at Bill, lost at what to do next. Bill leans inclose.
Go back to the beginning.
","(with a wink) The damn cat!The bell around the neck of Jack's cat KIT KAT jingles as itscurries away. Jack darts over, hangs the painting upsidedown.
(whispered to Allen) She painted it. Say nothing.Jack notices a piece of mail addressed to him next to Allen.It's an old vinyl RECORD sent by his friend Sammy. He shoutsdown the hall.
Hey when'd this come?
I dunno. Some battleship.Lucien nods to the huge manuscript on Allen's lap. We realizeit is Jack's novel The Sea Is My Brother.
Both of you! Quiet!Jack sets up an old phonograph. The scratchy record starts asJack sidles up close to the speaker.
Sammy, you bastard.
My best friend since I was twelve. Off in the Navy.
What's this?
You missed.Jack grabs his jacket.
Out.
What do you want me to do? Eat shoe leather? I'm hungry and what you do in the kitchen is unholy.
Shut your mouth, Edie.
So Al. You thought my novel was shit?
I've left school twice already. Columbia's full of squares. I'm not even sure why I bothered to come back.
Trust me. Sometimes when I fight with Edie, I want to.Lucien stops. He spots a DINGY, floating off a dock. He getsan idea.
Carr, you're goddamn crazy.Lucien RUNS for it, then Jack. Allen, now the third wheel,reluctantly chases after.
A ""new vision?""
Sounds phony. Movements are cooked up by people who can't write about the people who can.
Listen to me, this whole town's full of finks on the 30th floor, writing pure chintz. Writers, real writers, gotta be in the beds. In the trenches. In all the broken places. What're your trenches, Al?
Right.Allen looks to Lucien for help.
Good. That's one. What else?
Even better.
You're right. Who is you?Lucien loves this, raises an eyebrow. Allen pulls out hispoem from his pocket.
Allen. Beautiful, kid.Allen looks up, moved.
Jesus Christ!
No telling Edie, got it?Jack strolls up to the desk. Winks at the page.
I see you checking out all these books. And I'm asking myself: do you ever get checked out?She radiates. Bill looks at his watch.
(whispered) What just happened?Jack and Lucien grab the books from Allen and start to setthem in the cases. The alarm suddenly STOPS.
What the hell, Bill? It's locked!No way out. Allen turns, notices Lucien is missing.
Yep. Last year. They still won.
Have no fear. You never will.Suddenly, David appears in the bar. The group looks at eachother, mystified.
You little fink!Lucien explodes at David.
And...go!Jack crouched inside an empty barrel. Trashed, Lucien kicksthe barrel down a grassy slope.Allen and Lucien cheer Jack on as the barrel bangs down theslope. But then it swerves, SLAMS into a bench. At the top ofthe slope, Lucien and Allen look on in shock.
Wait, Al, you coming?Lucien glares at Allen.
Edie! Edie bird!Lucien looks at Edie's stone-cold face. She's pissed. Heturns right back around.
Then we should have a drink! How about a drink, Grandma Frankie? You want some red wine?Jack heads to the cabinet. Edie follows him.
I was out.Edie's rage boils over.
Stay. I'm sorry.
What the hell?!Jack jumps out of bed and grabs a baseball bat.
It's okay. Shhh. (turns to Lucien)
I'll wring his fucking neck.LUCIEN's P.O.V.: Jack's Merchant Marine duffel bag that Ediehas fully packed for him.
Goddamn son of a bitch!
I'm sorry.Edie embraces him.
Sammy...Jack places it on the record player and listens, clutchingEdie. He knows immediately there won't be another record.
It's Shelley's elegy for Keats.
It means he's dead.
Dad. It's five thousand dollars for bail. I know it's a lot--A flash bulb FIRES. Journalists cat-calling for Jack'sattention.
Would you all just SHUT THE HELL
