txt,"Installation ninety-five percent complete. Running level one diagnostics on circuits, sensors, and power. Standby.
I'm fine Houston.
Not any more than usual, Houston. Diagnostics are green. Linking to communications card. Ready for data reception. If this works, when we touch down tomorrow, I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.
OK, here we go... Booting comm card now. Please confirm link.
Stand by, Houston. I'm gonna reboot the comm card.
Comm card reboot in progress.
Houston, I'm fine, it's just...
No, we've been here for a week Houston, let's just finish this. RYAN STONE is a medical engineer, specialized in hospital scanning systems. She's focused on her work as though she's all alone in the world. This is her first mission. Ryan eyes the Card, then...
Try again.
Houston, could you please turn that music off?
Thank you, Kowalsky. Ryan moves the Card around.
Now, Houston?
Could Houston be misinterpreting the data--?
Mmmm. Let me see what's going on. She starts to disengage one of the panels.
Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components. The problem must be originating in the comms panel.
I'm on it.
An hour.
Assistance appreciated.
Certainly. Ryan begins unbolting. Matt lands right next to Ryan and grabs onto the telescope. She is frustrated, determined.
Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble dried. Matt takes out his pistol grip, and with fast precision puts its head to a bolt and begins unscrewing. Matt removes the bolt with confidence.
Whoa...! AWOL! The bolt spins floating away. She tries to grab it but MISSES, barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give it a push that makes it change direction.... She turns and reaches out to grab it, but she is strapped to the Robotic Arm. The bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when- A hand GRABS it before it has gone too far. It is Matt's. Ryan looks at him, embarrassed.
Thanks. Sorry. In my basement lab things usually fall to the floor. Matt puts the bolt away. He begins to unscrew another bolt.
Call me a genius if I can get this board initialized in the next hour.
Should we be worried?
Explorer, engage arm and pivot to cargo bay.
I was just happy that they didn't cut the funding to my research.
Six months.
Assuming it works, it's just for hospital use. This one is a prototype.
My eyes are brown. Matt stares at her, a faint smile on his face.
Mm-hm.
The silence.
Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead. Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?
Proceeding to over ride. Matt continues his story without missing a beat-
I can't. If I turn it off now we'll lose the whole system. She keeps on furiously tweaking.
Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done. The ROBOTIC ARM slowly withdraws, carrying Ryan back towards the Shuttle. Matt watches her go, then:
Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine o'clock. Matt's eyes shift, watching a LARGE OBJECT, a piece of a BSE SATELLITE, spiral toward them.
Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster transport. It is followed by a SMALL PIECE OF DEBRIS. It zooms by faster than the previous ones and hits the BSE SATELLITE. The satellite EXPLODES into hundreds of pieces and- A CHAIN REACTION takes place.
Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area. Explorer get me down.
I'm trying...
It's stuck! Further back, another piece of debris collides with a bigger one. The two chunks of debris explode into a million pieces of shrapnel, one of which- HITS Shariff's helmet, breaking through the glass and hitting his head like an expansive bullet.
Nooooo!
No.
(She pulls herself together) Ok. Ok.
I'm trying. I'm trying.
Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck, Hold on. Ryan's hands are trembling and she can't get a grip on the hook.
Yes. Yes. I copy. I'm detached! Ryan slowly spins, drifting into the empty darkness of space.
I don't know. I don't know! I'm spinning. I can't. I can't.
GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I can't.
I told you! Nothing. I see nothing!
It's too fast.
I can't breathe. I can't...breathe... She inhales and exhales with quick short breaths-
Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm drifting but I have a visual of Explorer. Her eyes scan the enveloping darkness, trying to get a fix on the gleaming orb that is earth, her face alive with concentration as she makes calculations.
With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle is at the center of the dial. She frowns as she tumbles backward again, recalculating. The sun is slipping behind the Earth. She studies the rim of fire until it too slides from view.
I can see the Chinese station. No, no, no, it's the International Space Station. The sun's glow illuminates another object in the distance, a bright spec hovering over the horizon- the INTERNATIONAL SPACE
ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock. Just then, the sun's rays recede and the Station DIMS, becoming one with the darkness. Ryan blinks, mildly alarmed.
Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy? Silence.
Explorer, do you copy? Silence. Slowly, the sun recedes further behind the earth and the light bathing Ryan's face evaporates. As she is swallowed by the darkness, she speaks once again:
Houston, do you copy?
Houston, this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm drifting. There is only the silence, complete and absolute.
Do you copy? Nothing. She watches the earth slip from view yet again. When next she speaks, the words are as delicate as snowflakes, tripping off her tongue like a prayer...
Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy. A soothing light hits Ryan's face. THE MOON is rising over the Pacific Ocean. It's almost full and its soft cool light pours over the globe, brightening the deep blue waters and-
(almost to herself) Lieutenant Kowalsky?... The flickering star begins to thicken...
YES! YES! I copy! I'm here! As she watches the figure of an astronaut takes shape.
My light?
Here! Here! Ryan opens a pouch in her suit, fishes out a FLASHLIGHT. Hands trembling she shines it toward the approaching dot.
I'm... I'm alright... I'm fine.
3.6 psi, I think.
Steady at eight percent...no seven...
Copy.
Please hurry. Ryan can see Matt quickly growing in size. She continues to
Oh. Sorry. She slips the light back into her side pouch just as Matt appears as if from nowhere and GRABS HER.
Arghh! Ryan holds on to Matt. Instantly, they begin to spin together. Matt takes out a tether.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it. He runs the other end of the tether to the harness on Ryan's suit and attaches it.
No... No... No... Wait... Don't. Matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a gentle nudge. Drifting again she begins to freak.
Nooooooo!!!! Dammit!!! The tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from Matt. Matt ignites the thrusters, tugging Ryan behind him. But this proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him, changing his direction.
Ahh Dammit!
Ahhh Dammit.
Why aren't they answering?
Can they hear us on an alternate frequency?
Why ninety?
02 down to six percent. As they travel, the Shuttle begins to take form.
Yeah. Pretty scary shit.
Where is he? Where is he? Shariff's body is tethered to a PANEL that was ripped away from the Explorer. Matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course, and- He grabs onto it. Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against Shariff's body. The contact slows her trajectory, but it throws Shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Matt, holding on to the metal, spins with it. He detaches Shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself. He lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster, pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring Ryan and Shariff closer together.
I'm trying. I'm trying.
I got him. I got him. Matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the Shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two bodies pulls him in all directions.
02 down to five percent. Matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps against the windshield of the COCKPIT. At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose of the Shuttle, losing her grip on Shariff. As she caroms off, she grabs onto what is left of the cockpit's window.
I apologize for not complying. I should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to.
Yes? She turns, no elbows this time.
Agreed.
02 down to two percent.
What?
Home?
Lake Zurich.
Illinois.
I don't know...
The radio. I listen to the radio...
Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as they don't talk. I just drive... Her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her, taking over her body. It is not fear, it is something deeper and more painful. Matt studies her curiously.
No...
I had a daughter. Her eyes flutter, then open. She is frozen in this moment, as if stunned. Her gaze shifts and finds- Matt, studying her in his MIRROR.
Sarah... She was four. Stupidest thing- a school trip to the swimming pool. She was playing tag- she slipped, hit her head, and that was it... She loved tag. I'm sure she was laughing. She looks away, toward Earth. It looks small. Remote.
When I received the call I was driving and ever since that's what I do. I wake up, I go to work and then I just drive. Matt finally averts his eyes. He rolls his wrist over, consults the timer, watching the numbers slowly count down.
02 down to one percent.
Uhuh?
Mmm...Mmmm.
I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure is low...
Shouldn't we be turning? We're
Break... You have to break.
I got it. I got it.
The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm I'm detached.
I've got you. I've got you-- The very tips of their fingers touch --
No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you. Don't. Don't. NO As the parachute tenses, she STOPS. The tether attached to Matt's suit passes two feet away from her
Gotcha! Matt's momentum is now pulling Ryan, dragging her loose from the parachute.
What? No--
No!
I'm not letting you go! We're fine. Her leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further out, being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her foot. (We move from high-angle to low angle two shot). As this
You're not going anywhere, you're not
Please don't do this. Matt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand.
Please don't do this. Please don't do this.
I had you! I had you. Matt drifts away from the Station into the empty space. Ryan bumps against the station, pulled by the parachute, and she twists and turns before finally grabbing hold of a rail.
My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm went off.
Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it.
Yes.
Ok. The transmission becomes weaker, filled with STATIC.
Sunday drive...?
I've never flown a Shenzhou--
Ok.
Only on a simulator.
I crashed it. I--
Every time. I crashed the Simulator every time.
I'm going to take the Soyuz and come get you.
No. I'm coming to get you.
But... I...
I'm... I'm going to make it.
Dad wanted a boy.
Not yet.
What?
You... you have beautiful... you have beautiful blue eyes.
What?
No... I'm coming to get you.
(in a daze) Matt... Only static hisses...
Matt! Static again as Matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming lost in a sea of white specks and- The transmission ends.
Come on, come on. She finds what she's looking for: a BAG OF WATER with a straw at one end. She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it. She DRINKS in long gulps, squeezing the bottle, trying to quench her thirst. DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water overflows. They float around her face like perfect pearls of different sizes. She takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath. The water is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty gulp and empties the bag. She checks the count on the STOPWATCH- 14 minutes and counting down. She takes a new bag of water from the drawer, and pushing herself off of a wall, she dives into the-
OK. Where are you? Where are you? Comms. Comms... There you are! Without stopping, she goes through one of the open hatches into
Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? She waits.
Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? Nothing... only static.
Matt, I made it. I'm here. I'm inside the Station... Do you copy? She drifts along the module, listening intently through the headset.
Come on Matt. Talk to me.
Where are you? Give me a visual... tell me what you see. Nothing.
Oh, come on. You've been yammering nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral, and now you decide to shut up? She waits ONE SECOND, TWO SECONDS-
Come on Matt, talk to me! The signal cuts in and out, but remains indecipherable. There is something unnerving about it. She drops her head and continues drifting toward the porthole, listening as the STATIC SPUTTERS.
Say something... Anything.
Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me about the hairy guy. What happened? Waiting for him to respond, and in a softer voice, completely
Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this. She bumps against the PORTHOLE, and glances out- The Earth glimmers brightly. A third of the hemisphere is in complete darkness. Her FACE REFLECTED in the glass is SUPERIMPOSED over the EARTH. Her eyes glisten briefly, but she fights it back. Then she pulls herself together, and begins reporting-
Houston in the blind. The way Matt would have done it-
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the ISS... All communication with Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio transmission is absent. Visual is nonexistent.
What now?
OK... where was it?... where was it? She moves her finger across the different buttons, searching.
Where is the power?... Here you are. Her finger stops on a button, which is labeled- BKN She presses on it and the CONTROL PANEL turns ON. All the buttons light up and with a hum, the Soyuz's systems start to run.
Good... good... just like training... Ryan reaches to the right, where next to the panel, there are several binders, each a different color.
Undocking... undocking... Yes... red... And she takes out a RED BINDER. It's all written in Cyrillic. She turns the pages until she sees a GRAPHIC representing the UNDOCKING PROCEDURE.
Ok... Ok... I remember this... undocking... She uses the CURSORS on the panel and selects a function on the
We don't have four minutes to spare. We're going manual... She flips through the binder to another page. She looks at a diagram and uses the cursors on the panel to change the function on the screen-
Okay. Arming the system... She releases the SAFETY LOCK on a BUTTON. AN EXPLOSION in the Station makes everything shake. The vibration passes through her body, startling her, and-
Firing the pyros... SHE PRESSES the BUTTON.
Rezerv rasstyk! The SOUND of a mechanism releasing reverberates throughout the vessel.
I engaged manual control- R O A K and RYD are activated. She grabs the joysticks with her hand, and-
Oh, no. No, no, no. She presses the joystick.
Great. Fantastic. Perfect.
Clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris. SHE HUMS A SONG, the tune is reminiscent of the Hank Williams Melody that Matt had played earlier. She begins to climb around the vessel. With plenty of oxygen in her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task. She pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around the Soyuz and reaching-
Okay. We detach this and we go home. Piece of cake. She harnesses the bag and RESUMES her HUMMING, louder this time. She unzips the bag and takes out the PISTOL GRIP tool, without noticing that behind her- DOZENS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS pass, zooming less than thirty meters away from the Station. A tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the Station's Solar panels, shattering it and causing the Station to tremble. She places the tool against the FIRST BOLT, stretching her arm into the parachute container. It is an awkward position. She pulls the trigger and the drill rotates, turning the bolt, but it slides out of the notch. She places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the trigger. The drill rotates, SLOWER this time. She HUMS under her breath and SWEAT begins to drop down her forehead. She is very focused, unaware that behind her- DEBRIS HITS THE STATION'S SOLAR PANEL, piercing holes through it.
Oh shit. THE TIDE OF DEBRIS is floating STRAIGHT AT HER. She pulls herself back to the container.
Shit! The Soyuz is heading straight towards the Station's Solar Panels.
No... no... no.. The Soyuz' Solar Panel collides with the Station's, shattering into smaller pieces of debris that almost hit Ryan. The Soyuz spins away as-
I hate space.
Shut up! She presses different buttons, and with each a voice of the alarm symphony dies until they are completely silent.
Ok. She takes a breath and begins fastening the seat belt.
Alright. That's good. She puts on the communication headset and- Resets the STOPWATCH- 85 minutes and counting down. She checks the TEMPERATURE GAUGE- She exhales, the plume of her hot breath hanging briefly in the frigid cabin air before evaporating.
Okay, let's stabilise you. She takes the JOYSTICK. Ryan looks focused at-
Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station. Houston in the blind, Tiangong is approximately 100km... to the west and I am off it's course by about 3 degrees. I will correct trajectory. She moves the Joystick, and the crosshair readjusts.
Ok. She releases the safety lock and places her finger on the button.
Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five... four... three She releases the safety lock.
two... one... She pushes on the button.
One... Nothing. The thruster won't ignite.
One... one...
Come on. Come on!
You gotta be kidding me. She taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the needle to go back up, and once again-
Where's your backup? She taps even harder this time.
Where's your goddamn backup?! She bangs down on the control panel in frustration--
This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy?
Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? She turns her neck stiffly, looks at the- TEMPERATURE DIAL, -8 degrees and dropping. Through the PORTHOLE the SUN drops. DARKNESS descends. Finally, a SOUND SURFACES through the static:
Houston. Houston! This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. Do you copy! This glimmer of hope gives her a new burst of energy. She TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT and attempts to tune into the frequency, turning one of the control panel's dials. She frowns.
(into the mouthpiece) Houston, you're coming in over the AM frequency. Please confirm identity. Fragmented words emerge through the static.
Repeat. This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone from STS-157. Do you copy? Words BURST FORTH, ringing clear as a bell for a moment.
Is this the Chinese Station? Is this Tiangong? Copy? As she tunes in a faint voice is distinguished. It doesn't appear to be in Chinese either.
Do you speak English?
S.O.S. Do you understand?
Mayday! Can you copy? Mayday! Mayday! The voice on the transmission appears to be a man in a very jovial mood. He keeps laughing.
Yes! Mayday! Mayday!
Aningang?
No, Mayday's not my name. I'm Stone, Dr. Ryan Stone-- I need help.
Where are you, Aningang? Is the sun out? Are there birds? Are there trees? Can you smell the ocean?
Is it beautiful where you are? Here it's colder than hell and lonelier than shit, but it's beautiful Aningang. Utterly, terrifyingly beautiful. Through THE PORTHOLE- Even under the darkness of night, it is possible to see the glaciers spreading over the green forests. It all looks so fresh and full of life.
Make your dogs bark again, Aningang. Will you? Please...
Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof. She makes barking noises. The man begins to laugh and barks back at her.
Woof. Woof.
I'm going to die, Aningang. The SIGNAL ebbs, losing its battle with the STATIC.
I mean, we're all going to die. Everyone knows that. But I'm going to die today... The STATIC waffles in and out.
Funny that. To know. The STATIC breaks and Aningang's HUSKY VOICE begins SINGING.
And you know what Aningang... I don't care. I don't care if I die. I don't have anything... not anymore. Ryan is floating now over her seat.
But the thing is... I'm still scared. I'm really scared... She rolls in space and stares upwards...
No one will mourn me. No one will pray for my soul. Will you mourn me, Aningang? Is it too late to say a prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I have never prayed in my life... no one ever taught me how... The tune is lyrical and soothing, tinged with a touch of melancholy.
No one ever taught me how... Ryan listens to Aningang's melody and smiles softly, closing her eyes. Ryan's face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness, buoyed along on Aningang's sad soulful song. Then... ...a SPUTTERING CRY cuts through the static.
A baby. There's a baby with you. A beat. Aningang stops singing, speaking in a soft voice:
You are singing to your baby? Is that a lullaby? That's so sweet! Ryan is transfixed, listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby as Aningang coos to it, then begins to SING again.
I used to sing to my baby too. Painful memories flash before her, haunting her. Ryan's lump in her throat is washed away by a gentle sob.
I hope I see her soon. She reaches for a valve and opens it. A HIZZING sound is heard inside the vessel, and-
(growing ever drowsier) That's nice. Keep singing, Aningang, just like that. Sing me to sleep. I'll sleep and sleep and sleep. Sing to me, Aningang... sing...sing.... The transmission grows fainter... ...and fainter... ...and then is... ...gone. For a long beat Ryan merely sits there. She is gently humming a tune. It is a LULLABY.
No... no.. don't. But the latch continues to open. Ryan immediately straps herself to the commander chair. The latch keeps turning. Ryan covers her eyes and face with her hands when- THE LATCH RELEASES and
How did you?
But how did you? He reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of switches. Instantly, the alarms go silent.
How? Ryan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how-
You never told me where. Matt fishes a SMALL FLASK from under his seat, spins off the cap...
No. He studies her.
We can't.
There's no fuel. I tried everything.
I tried everything.
They're for landing so.
I never got to land the simulator, I told you.
And I crashed it every time. Ryan is falling asleep. Matt studies her as she dozes off.
How did you get here?
What? Ryan is asleep.
Landing, landing. Landing is launching. With a new surge of determination she TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT. She pulls the HELMET floating above her and puts it on. She connects the umbilical to her suit, opens the Oxygen Valve, and begins to breath. As the Oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of determination brightens her face. She opens the valves of the other two umbilicals, allowing Oxygen to flow, pressurizing the cabin. She grabs the MANUAL.
Okay, landing, landing, landing is green. She opens the green binder and browses through its index.
Okay, okay landing, alright. She stops, turns some pages and stares closely at the manual. Ryan notices the Energy Bar floating by her. She grabs it and as she opens the wrapper, she stares intently at one page of the MANUAL, where there is-
Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing. ... you're a clever son of a bitch Matt. So to land I need to get rid of the BO and Engine module, okay? She puts on the communication headset.
Listen to me Matt. You're going to see a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah, her hair is probably a mess. That's okay, she doesn't like to brush it. She looks out of the porthole, down at Earth.
Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She was so upset about that shoe Matt, but tell her it was right under the bed. She turns back to the console and places her finger over one of the buttons.
You give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell her she's my little angel and that she makes me so proud, so so so proud, and that I promise I'll try and make her proud too. You tell her that I'm not quitting, that I'm going to keep fighting. You tell her I love her Matt... I love her so much. Ryan smiles, remembering... and then-
Tri module separation, go... She presses the button.
Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth. A pause, and then-
Let's reset you then. Using the manual as a reference, Ryan uses the cursors to select the ALTITUDE DISPLAY on the computer screen. The current ALTITUDE is- 2600 M. She uses the cursors and presses a button. A WARNING on the computer screen comes on. She presses another button, and- ON THE SCREEN, the ALTITUDE goes blank. Ryan punches a new set of commands. The ALTITUDE now reads- 3 meters.
Okay. I only have one shot at this. One shot... She extends her finger...
What's the point if we don't try?
Wow... you were right Matt... it's magnificent.... She then turns to-
You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. But not before I get to you. You have my last ride home. A new sense of urgency comes up on Ryan's face. She unhooks the umbilical from her suit. She unstraps herself. She floats over and looks out of-
Okay, I'm done with just driving. Let's get go home. She turns the latch, and- PYROTECHNICS shoot the porthole into space. The brutal force of the infinite VACUUM of space SUCKS THE AIR out of the cabin, and- Ryan is LAUNCHED out of the cabin at a tremendous speed. SHE HITS HER SHOULDER as she goes through the hatch into-
Ahhhhhh! The pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod,
Come on. Come on. And when the RED GLOW turns to ORANGE- Ryan UNLOCKS her helmet and, using only her left hand, struggles to take it off. As the helmet floats, bouncing off of the cabin walls, Ryan massages her injured shoulder. She does this gently, as even the smallest pressure inflicts pain. The orange light is turning green when- She feels the Station quake fiercely, reverberating through the handle she's holding onto.
Seriously?
In the Soyuz the power button is erm....here! She passes her finger over the board, trying to make sense of the buttons.
Ah, ok ah undocking, undocking....eenie, meenie,...
Ok. That doesn't sound good.... She glances around frantically, turns it off. It's shaking very intensely but she's wide-eyed now, clearly close to being beside herself.
Miini... moh... She tries a BIG BUTTON that says- A NEW ALARM, followed by a NEW RECORDING, also a warning- And with a horrible accent-
No hablo chino. She keeps searching for the right button.
Mini... moh... And she presses a new one. The LIGHTS on the Control Panel GO ON. The cabin makes a humming sound as SYSTEMS BEGIN TO ACTIVATE. On the control panel lights go on in patterns reminiscent of the switchboard in the Soyuz.
Okay....okay... She begins going through the progressions she used on the Soyuz, only quicker this time, jabbing button after button.
Good...good...There. And this should be... She presses one more button and systems turn to green.
Okay... Houston in the blind... She raises her voice to be heard over the GROWING RUMBLE.
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the Shenzhou. I'm about to undock from the Tiangong and I have a bad feeling about this mission. She presses a new button and the system goes to green. And on the MONITOR a COUNTDOWN appears.
Reminds me of a story, Houston-- She reacts to a bad shake of the cabin.
Okay, you know what, Houston? Never mind the story... She looks around as the cabin starts shaking even harder.
It's getting hotter in here. She watches the COUNTDOWN on the MONITOR- 3:59... 3:58...
The way I figure it, there's only two
I either make it down in one piece and I'll have one hell of a story to tell... And now the noise and the shake are nearing their peak...
...Or I burn up in the next ten minutes. Ryan smiles, flips the safety lid of a button open.
Whichever way it goes, no harm no foul. As the cabin RATTLES VIOLENTLY.
Because either way-- She closes her eyes, puts her finger over the button.
It'll be one hell of a ride. Ryan presses the button.
I'm ready.
Yeehaaa! GRAVITY is still minimal, but the force of the inertia is rough and it jerks her around. She sees- A RED LEVER above her, but she can only reach it with her bad hand.
Ahhhhhhhh!
Thank you. She PLANTS HER PALMS against the ground and- With an effort, she pushes herself up. SHE FEELS HER WEIGHT, and manages to rise to her hands and knees like a four-legged mammal. And she STANDS UP. ONE FOOT FALLS heavily on the ground. It sinks into the mud and
Ahhhhh!!! One foot moves forward and lands on more solid ground, unstable, coping with the weight. And then- The other foot follows as- SHE BEGINS TO WALK ON PLANET EARTH, laughing.
","Okay, let me tell you a story. It was '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every time I passed over Texas, I'd look down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky, was looking up, thinking of me. Six weeks I'm blowing kisses to that woman. Then we land at Edwards and I find out she'd run off with a lawyer before I was off the launch pad, so I packed my car and I headed to...
Five hours off the reservation and I show 30% drain. My compliments to Engineering. Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.
Tell them I still prefer my '67 Corvette though. Speaking of which did I ever tell you the--
Even Engineering?
He appears to be doing the Macarena of some sort. Though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part. Matt is now approaching the Explorer, skillfully maneuvering his thrusters. The other astronaut stands perched on a ROBOTIC ARM attached to the Shuttle. The arm is a crane-like moving platform remotely operated from inside the Shuttle. We TRACK In on the astronaut as she works intently alone.
Not a problem. Matt toggles a switch and the music stops.
Seventy-five minutes shy. Never crossed my mind.
Right back atcha, Houston.
Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in removing the panel?
Thank you, Houston.
How are you feeling?
It's been a rough week. If it makes you feel any better, I puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ride. Ryan is not as precise with her pistol grip, and when a bolt
Hey -- you're the genius up here. I just drive this bus.
Let the boys down there worry for us.
So doc, now that you work for NASA, how do you like it?
How long was your training?
So, what is this scanning system?
Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes, even for your pretty blue eyes. She gives him a look.
Right now your eyes are blood shut. She grins, looks away -- he got her. Then...
(for Ryan's benefit) And to think he went to Harvard. Ryan doesn't react to this, too consumed as she is with the panel. Matt looks out. A sad smile is on his face.
You gotta admit one thing. You can't beat the view....
""Mmm?"" So what do you like about being up here? She hesitates -- trying sincerely to articulate her feelings as we GAZE down at the silent planet below.
Hmmmm. Terrific. Ryan inspects a panel inside the telescope, studying it with a small mirror.
Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
It's the same feeling I had at Mardi Gras in 1987...? He waits, letting the moment hang knowingly. Then:
Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for the sister of a friend of mine. The streets are swimming with people, I'm thinking there's no way I'm finding this girl... Ryan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself-
Then all of a sudden I look up and -- there she is.
Roger. Explorer, prep airlock!
Houston. Elaborate.
Copy all Houston.
I'm not going to ask you again.
Not one second. Now! Shut it down!
Alright Shariff, let's do this.
Houston. Update. Matt PROPELS himself to the base of the Hubble using the propelling unit on his back.
Right of disposal. Most likely a spy sat gone bad. Now it's space junk. Matt grabs onto the base of the telescope-
Explorer, ready to disengage HST.
What's the blowback, Houston?
Define ""multiple"" sats.
Half of North America just lost their Facebook. The sat glides by at tremendous speed.
Explorer, this is Kowalsky. Confirming visual contact with debris. Debris is from a BSE sat. To repeat--
To repeat I have- ANOTHER OBJECT, part of a WEATHER SATELLITE, hurls by them, a little bit closer than the previous one.
We have to go. Go, go! Go! The DEBRIS from the BSE satellite hits the WEATHER SATELLITE, and it EXPLODES, sending debris in all directions.
Explorer permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.
Unstrap! You can't tune out the world up here. She reaches for the last clip and begins to undo it.
Try releasing the safety clip. Shariff makes his way back toward the airlock as- A PIECE of the debris HITS the Hubble's SOLAR PANELS, making a 12-inch HOLE in its golden surface. A piece of debris passes, nearly hitting them.
No, don't wait for us. Get inside.
Man down! Man down! Matt PROPELS himself toward Shariff, who is floating away from the Shuttle unconscious.
Explorer has been hit. Explorer do you read? Explorer, over. Explorer-- Another IMPACT. A piece of debris HITS the robotic arm like a cannon ball and DETACHES it from the Shuttle. The broken piece of the arm SPINS AWAY from the Explorer at a great speed with Ryan attached to it. She passes next to- THE HUBBLE as a big piece of debris hits the telescope. The top of the cylinder explodes into more debris, which is expelled in all directions, barely missing Ryan as she spins away attached to the arm.
Astronaut off structure! Dr. Stone is off structure! With every spin, the shuttle, being punished by debris, diminishes into a tiny dot in the distance.
If you don't detach that arm is going to carry you too far!
(a brief beat, then) Listen to my voice. You need to focus. I'm losing visual of you. In a few seconds I won't be able to track you.
You need to detach. I can't see you anymore. The robotic arm keeps on spinning and stars orbit wildly in her field of vision.
Do it. Now!
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone... Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone. As Matt's VOICE is LOST to STATIC, Ryan squeezes the hook and is... ...gone, kicking herself AWAY from the robotic arm and FLYING FREE of the rotating arm. She catches a brief glimpse of the arm as it helicopters away, then loses sight of it as she rotates end over end in endless free fall. A PRIMAL SCREAM of God forsaken fear erupts from her lungs. The RADIO CRACKLES and Matt's VOICE returns.
Dr. Stone! Do you copy?! Repeat! Do you copy?
...Give me your position!
Report your position. Tumbling end over end, Ryan fixes her gaze on her wrist. The effort makes her nauseous. She looks away.
Give me a visual. Matt's faint voice is heard on the transmission under a lot of static. Ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate. Her eyes rake the dark sameness of her surroundings.
Do you have a visual of Explorer?
Do you have a visual of ISS?
I need you to focus. Give me a visual... anything. Ryan's eyes flutter, then roll up into her sockets...
Your O2. Give me your O2.
Nearly there.
Gotcha.
Now, I'm going to tether you to me. Ryan is paralyzed, holding onto Matt tightly and looking at him in fright. He stares back.
I know. You never realized how devastatingly good-looking I am. Matt grins.
But I need you to stop staring and help me with the tether. Okay?
Ok. So far so good. Now listen. I'm going to give you a little push, just so you're clear of the jets--
Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.
See? Where you go, I go. Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position. As he does so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again.
Better. Let's get out of here. Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and, igniting a long thrust, he jets away. Ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and SHE SCREAMS-
I know what you mean.
You're burning oxygen, we're going to go back to the shuttle. How's that for a plan. Copy?
Right copy that. As Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit, his momentum takes over, steadying Ryan's swing.
Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you copy?
It seems like communications are lost.
We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes. Matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for- 90 MINUTES.
Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. Factoring in our current orbit, I reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again. Ryan sets her watch, studies the counter as it begins to count down.
Okay. Pretty scary shit being untethered up here, isn't it?
(after a beat) You did all right. Silence.
(to the Shuttle) Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalsky. Our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve the body of Mission Specialist Shariff and return it to Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve? Silence.
Roger that. Matt changes direction and approaches Shariff. He has to ignite several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting against Ryan's momentum.
Grab him!
Quick. You're pulling me away.
Clutch him like he's your Valentine. I can't gauge my thrust with you two yo- yoing around. Tentatively Ryan extends her right hand to grab onto Shariff's body harness. And she sees- Shariff's broken helmet. A hole the size of a soft ball pierces through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess. Ryan's face is inscrutable. Finally she looks away, but this time something arrests her gaze: A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff, tethered to his suit via a small chain. In it, a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with abandon, happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG ARMS. Transfixed, Ryan is unable to look away, something complicated confusing her eyes. The photograph floats in the empty space above Planet Earth.
(under his breath) Jesus... The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage. The tail is beyond repair, one wing is completely destroyed, while the other waffles weakly, nearly sheared from the fuselage.
All right, here we go. Careful of the edges. Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows, lighting the cockpit. Ryan pulls herself up and looks-
Houston, in the blind. To confirm. Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and myself, Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky, are the sole survivors of
We were going to be hit no matter what. There was nothing you could've done to change that. He begins to reach out, hesitates briefly, then lightly touches her shoulder.
Hey.
Alright... We have to get ourselves to the Space Station. There. Matt gestures vaguely to a bright dot in distance.
It's a bit of a hike, but it's our only...
Dr. Stone... (as she turns) Agreed? She studies his face and then, finally, nods.
Alright. After you. He gently pushes her into space. She slowly drifts away from the Explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether. Matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small thrusts, he combats Ryan's swing. And with a LONGER THRUST- He shoots forward, pulling Ryan behind him. The two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble.
Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky. Dr. Stone and I have determined to proceed to ISS and use one of their Soyuz for re-entry. ISS if copy, please send rescue mission. Repeat please dispatch rescue mission. They are heading toward a small point in the distance, the Space Station, which is in a lower orbit.
We're getting there.
Beautiful, don't you think?
The sunrise. That's what I'm going to miss the most. But Ryan is not into the view right now. She's stricken with fear. Her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed. Matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles.
So, where's home, Dr. Stone? Ryan keeps her eyes closed, doesn't answer. Matt, trying to
Ryan. Where's home? Ryan opens her eyes, but still she doesn't dare to look out of the helmet.
Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where do you pitch your tent?
Where the hell is that?
Illinois. Central time zone. That makes it roughly... 8pm right now. What are the good people of Lake Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the evening? Ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out. She frowns, terrified by the sight, and hides her face once more inside the helmet.
What would you be doing? She tries again. This time she forces herself and stares out at the Earth, which is over 500 kilometers below her.
Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just clocked out of the hospital after putting in your customary 18-hour shift. You're driving home... Ryan's wide open eyes are transfixed on Earth, like a deer in headlights.
There we go. Let me guess. NPR? Classical. Top for--
What do you miss down there? Ryan looks at the Earth. It never felt so far away. A long silence without an answer.
Is there a Mr. Stone? She frowns, unable to comprehend this initially, as if it were a particularly complicated bit of math, then shakes her head.
Nobody special? Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you? Ryan closes her eyes. She remains silent. A silence that can't hide an unspeakable pain.
What was her name?
Well, well, what d'you know. I have good news and bad news.
The good news is we're five minutes from the ISS and I know where the Russians stash their vodka... and that's a good thing cus I'm running out of fumes. Bad news is I'm gonna be ten minutes short of......breaking Anatoly's record.
What?
The tank may be empty but there's still oxygen in your suit, so sip, Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, not beer. Sip. We'll get you there. She nods.
Let's go. Matt gives Ryan a gentle push, waiting until the tether goes taut, and- He gives a SMALL THRUST to position himself in the right direction. He holds this SINGLE THRUST for longer than all of the previous ones, immediately gaining speed, descending towards-
Houston in the blind we have visual of the ISS. Station must have been evacuated because first Soyuz is missing. Second Soyuz exhibits surface damage and chute has deployed. It's use as escape pod for re-entry to Earth is impossible. The surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels have been ripped. THE SECOND SOYUZ becomes visible, attached to the Station's Docking Module. A piece of red and white fabric floats around the spherical capsule. Ryan's losing her breath.
Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We want to drift. I wasn't kidding about those fumes. This can has one or two good thrusts left. If we're lucky.... They approach the Space Station, which is just ahead of them and a hundred meters below. She's sweating and starts to hyperventilate.
Steady... She looks down, eyes the Station passing beneath them.
Ready... aim... It looks as though the Station is going to slip away altogether.
...fire. Matt triggers his THRUSTER, turning sharply. Ryan's trajectory carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses, breaking Matt's direction. He fires again to counter her momentum. A VERY LONG THRUST sends both of them in the right direction, straight down toward the Station, but at great speed. The Station is getting very close, and they're going very fast. Matt ignites the FRONTAL THRUSTER, which begins to slow him down, but the thrust stops. Ryan, following her own momentum, begins to pass Matt.
I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab onto anything you can and hold tight! Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to grab hold. As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms. Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station. As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing. Ryan passes flying above him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt. The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing. Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but she's floating too high. She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the black void. She extends her arm and GRABS the handle tightly for dear life
Grab a hold. Grab anything. Ryan is drifting away from the Station. She sees the infinite black void ahead of her and-
Shit... shit...
You have to let me go.
You have to.
Those ropes are too loose, I'm pulling you with me. You have to let me go or we both die--
Ryan!
It's not up to you. Matt begins to unharness the tether.
You're going to make it Ryan.
You need to board the station. Can you see the airlock? She turns, looking for the Station's Airlock.
That's because you're breathing CO2 and you're losing consciousness. You need to board the Station. Her eyes flutter...
No you're not. . I have too much of a head start. That ship already sailed.
Ryan, you're going to have to learn to let go.
Alright. Keep going Ryan stares at Matt's tiny figure in the distance.
What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?
Are you close to the airlock?
Keep going. Ryan continues to the Airlock.
So, now that we have some distance between us- you're attracted to me, aren't you?
Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes.
I have brown eyes... that hurts. She looks at Matt's figure receding.
You know, Ryan is a nice name for a girl. Wow, you should see the sun on the Ganges. It's amazing. Ryan starts to respond, then falters, watching Matt's figure grow ever smaller. THE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying radio.
Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped. The figure glances around.
Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little light? He taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms: Matt. Ryan stares, mouth agape.
Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
That's better.
I found a little extra battery power. I'm just happy you're still alive. To be honest, I thought your chances were slim to none. By the way, did you find the vodka?
Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje. ...and takes a big gulp. He offers the flask to Ryan, who appears to be dozing off. She blinks, shakes her head.
No? Right, let's get out of here. He looks at the monitors, where the Chinese Station is seen.
We're `bout a hundred miles to the Chinese Station. A little Sunday drive.
Course we can.
Well, there's always something we can do.
Did you try the soft landing jets?
Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training?
But you know about it.
Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? I get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody. Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the cabin lights off.
There's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe. Then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living? When the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at Ryan.
Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride. You have to start living life, Ryan. Ryan is having trouble keeping her eyes open.
Ryan, you have to learn to let go ... Hey? Ryan is almost sound asleep.
It's time to go home. Her eyes snap open. Her gaze shifts. The flask is floating in front of her. But no Matt. She turns. THE CABIN IS EMPTY. She turns back.
","
Ryan is SHAKEN and RATTLED in her seat.
The spinning is punishing. Ryan is shaken violently. She is also mumbling words to herself that we can't hear. It looks like she rambling. Some LIGHTS GO OFF.

In THE PORTHOLE- Outside burning debris is passing by. The gravitational pull keeps Ryan tense in her seat as drops fall on her face. She
The impact is felt inside and a panel falls off. A small smoke trail is formed around its wires. Ryan is restrained against her seat by the gravitational force of the fall and-
A BREATH OF RELIEF, as through THE PORTHOLE- She sees the ropes of the parachute extend out to the large canvas cushioning the fall.
Ryan starts COUGHING. The cabin is quickly filling with SMOKE, and- The white cloud of smoke overflowing the small space is getting thicker.
She coughs as the white smoke is becoming unbearable. She's suffocating.
Ryan feels the cabin hit the water. She has landed safely. But she cannot celebrate because she can't stop coughing. She is asphyxiating in the thick cloud of smoke. She UNSTRAPS herself and- Reaches a LEVER at the side of the hatch. She PULLS THE LEVER.
She begins to unstrap herself when- WATER POURS IN through the open hatch. She tries to make her way out, fighting against the strong current that is gushing in, but the flow is too strong and-
Air trapped inside Ryan's suit leaks out through the collar and small bubbles float up. Ryan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm, she swims out.
","And through the glass she sees that- The Station is coming straight at her and it looks as though-
The parachute is tangled with a solar panel and the ropes are tensing up, and-
The rope extends from the cabin to the parachute tangled with the Station.
THROUGH THE GLASS, the helmet of an astronaut is looking in.
The Chinese Station is approaching, getting closer. She disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the LATCH. She pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and holds it tightly against her chest with one arm. With the other arm- She reaches for the Latch. The Station is hovering right next to her and the cabin is going to pass it.
A thin bright yellow halo covers the whole window.
A blinding light pours in from outside the window. The spinning is over, but the cabin vibrates with a loud rumble. As the G-Force restrains Ryan against her seat, she clenches her face and sweats. On the ceiling, condensation begins to form.
","(On radio, faint) Explorer, please verify that the P1 ATA removal on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete.
(On radio, faint) Copy that Explorer. Dr Stone-Houston, requesting status update... A fizz of static and then the voice continues with sudden, starling clarity.
Please expand.
Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack prototype. Matt smiles, checks the monitors of the sleek device strapped to his back.
Especially engineering. We're going to miss you, Matt. Matt grins, fiddles with a control and propels himself away from the Shuttle. Stationed around the telescope are TWO ASTRONAUTS carrying out a repair mission. They are also wearing space suits but unlike Matt, they are not wearing Manned Maneuvering Units. SAFETY TETHERS are the only things stopping them from floating away into space.
Dr. Stone. Houston. Medical now have you with a temperature drop to 35.9 and heart rate rise to 70. How are you doing?
Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer? Ryan HUMS as she jiggles the CARD.
(a beat, then...) Still nothing.
Negative.
Houston trusts Mission Commander Kowalsky realizes that this delay is not of sufficient duration to enable him to surpass Anatoly's Solovyev's spacewalking record, as most recent calculations indicate that he will be left...
Explorer, this is Houston.
NORAD reports a satellite has incurred a missile strike. The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour. Current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory. We'll keep you posted on any developments. Ryan glances at Matt.
You're the expert, doctor. It's your call. Ryan takes out the small mirror and Matt stretches his arm, offering assistance, but- She does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her toolbox, leaving Matt with his arm outstretched. Ryan starts looking for another tool, but Matt is one move ahead of her, offering her a pair of tweezers. Ryan hesitates and takes the tool. She starts working on the panel.
Please elaborate.
That is affirmative. Surprisingly, control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed.
We have a full on chain reaction. It's been confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own satellites. Shariff arrives to the base of the telescope.
Explorer, new data coming through. As it floats away, Matt gives the telescope a small spin.
It's not good. Most of our systems are going down. Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding. Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling. Matt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts, carrying Ryan back.
Most of them. Telecomunications systems are gone. Expect a communication blackout at any moment.
You're a go for TH1138. Repeat You're a go for TH1138 procedure.
Attention. New data suggests immediate evacuation absolu... A high frequency of interference and-
