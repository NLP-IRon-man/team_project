txt,"Hello Mr. Nolan.
Thank you, sir.
I'll do my best sir.
Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.He shakes Todd's hand.
I'm Neil Perry.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
Hey Knox.Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd across the back with it.CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox andMEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil
Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead. How was your summer Slick?
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?
Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind including him?
Come on, he's your roommate.
Oh, this is Todd Anderson.Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.
Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.
It's open.The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises fromthe window.
Father, I thought you'd gone.The other boys stand up when he enters.
But I'm the assistant editor this year.
But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.
Father, I wasn't disputing-
Yes sir. I'm sorry.
Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.
Yes sir.Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his headback against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.
Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr. Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.
Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You guys are the same way.
What I have to do. Drop the annual.
I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.
Yes.
But different.
Me.
Anything's better than Hell-ton hash.
Hey, you coming to the study group tonight?
Suit yourself.
Of course.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech. Then ask two questions: One, how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered, and two, how important is that objective. Question one rates the poem's perfection, question two rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining a poem's greatest becomes a relatively simple matter.Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.
If the poem's score for perfection is plotted along the horizontal of a graph, and its importance is plotted on the vertical, then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness.Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the studentsdutifully copy it down.
A sonnet by Byron may score high on the vertical, but only average on the horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. As you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice this rating method. As your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will - so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry.Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sittingacross from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away fromthe chalkboard with a smile.
Rip, rip, rip!Neil makes Cameron turn back around.
Hey, I found his senior annual in the library.He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating.
Listen to this, captain of the soccer team, editor of the school annual, Cambridge bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.
I don't know.
Nothing. No other mention of it.
Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain, My Captain?Keating immediately turns around.
We were just looking in your old annual.He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.
What was the Dead Poets Society?
Why? What was it?
Sure.The other boys crouch down around Keating.
Dead Poets Society.
I say we go tonight.
It's beyond the stream. I know where it is.
All right, who's in?
Forget Hager, no. Who's in?
What? Pitts-
You can help him Meeks.
Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, are your grades hurting too?
(whispering) Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall. It's right there. It's got to be on the banks.
Todd, are you coming tonight?
Why not? God, you were there. You heard Keating. Don't you want to do something about it?
But? But what?
Gosh, you really have a problem with that, don't you?
All right. What if you didn't have to read? What if you just came and listened?
Forget how it works. What if - what if they said it was okay?
I'll be right back.
You're in.
You okay?
All right, all right, forget the fire. Let's go gentlemen.Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a dragon a cigarette.
I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets Society.The boys cheer.
Welton chapter. The meetings will be conducted by myself and the other new initiates now present. Todd Anderson, because he prefers not to read, will keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now read the traditional opening message by society member Henry David Thoreau. ""I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.""
""To put to rout all that was not life, and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.
And Keating's marked a bunch of other pages.Neil begins flipping through the book.
Raisins?
It was a dark and rainy night, and this old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw puzzles, sat by herself in her house at her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle. But as she pieced the puzzle together, she realized, to her astonishment, that the image that was formed was her very own room. And the figure in the center of the puzzle, as she completed it, was herself. And with trembling hands, she placed the last four pieces and stared in horror at the face of a demented madman at the window. The last thing that this old lady ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.
This is true, this is true.
You memorized a poem?
You know this is history. Right? This is history.Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,Miss October, 1959)
Wow! Did you write that?Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written downthe poem.
Alfred Lord Tennyson. Come my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world for my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset. And though we are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is performing a chant.
Uh, to communicate.
I found it.
What I wanna do right now. What's really, really inside me.
This is it.
It's a play, dummy.
Right. They're putting it on at Henley Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts!
So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna be an actor! Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to try this. I even tried to go to summer stock auditions last year, but, of course, my father wouldn't let me. For the first time in my whole life I know what I wanna do.Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them intothe air.
and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem!
First I gotta get the part, then I can worry about that.
No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of this.
Bullshit! Nothing's impossible.
That's a laugh!Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.
If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying him.
(shouting angrily) Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takesthe flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his excitement gone.
I mean, I haven't even gotten the part yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a little while? Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on theheater and Todd returns to his poem.
You're coming to the meeting this afternoon?
Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it, Todd?
You're in the club! Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool. Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd.
No! I want you in, but being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in.
Don't you think you could be?
No.
No. Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with it. Todd leaps up after him.
""We are dreaming of a--"" Poetry! I'm being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, okay.Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room.
Charlie!Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie.
Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play Puck! I'm gonna play Puck!He pounds on Charlie's door.
That's the main part.
Charlie, I got it!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
They need a letter of permission from my father and Mr. Nolan.
Oh yes, I am.
Okay. ""I am writing to you on behalf of my son Neil Perry.""Neil begins laughing and stomping his feet up and down.
This is great.
Friend, scholar, Welton men.
No. This is the god of the cave.
Where are you going?
Todd? Hey.
What's going on?
Is today your birthday? Happy birthday.
What's you get?
Isn't this the same desk set-
Oh.
(laughing) Maybe they thought you needed another one.
Todd, I think you're underestimating the value of this desk set.Neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.
I mean, who would want a football or a baseball, or-
Or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if I were ever going to buy a, a desk set twice, I would probably buy this one both times. In fact, its, its shape is, it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can feel it. This desk set wants to fly.Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands upand Neil hands him the desk set.
Todd? The world's first unmanned flying desk set.Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and itfalls to pieces down below.
Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get another one next year.
Hello.
Nuwanda? Tina takes out a tube of red lipstick. Charlie takes it from herand puts red marks on each of his cheeks.
Join? Charlie leans over to Tina.
How did you do that?
All right, but you still shouldn't have done it, Charlie. This could mean trouble. You don't speak for the club.
You kicked out?
So what happened?
So, what are you gonna do? Charlie!
Save some for me. ""But, room, Fairy! Here comes Oberon.""Neil opens the door to his room and sees his father sitting at his desk.
Father.
Wait a minute. Before you say anything, please let me ex-Mr. Perry rises from the desk.
No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. I've gotten all A's in every class.
No, I can't. I have the main part. The performance is tomorrow night.
Yes, sir. Mr. Perry goes to leave and then turns around.
No, sir.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I'm sorry. Here.
Tea. Sure.Keating goes to a table in the corner and begins pouring several cups.
No, thanks.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here.
She's pretty.
How can you stand it?
You can go anywhere. You can do anything. How can you stand being here?
I just talked to my father. He's making me quit the play at Henley Hall. Acting's everything to me. I-- But he doesn't know. He-- I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's, and we-- But he's planning the rest of my life for me, and I-- H-He's never asked me what I want.
I can't.
I can't talk to him this way.
I know what he'll say. He'll tell me that acting's a whim, and I should forget it. That how they're counting on me. He'll just tell me to put it out of my mind, ""for my own good.""
No. What about the play? The show's tomorrow night.
Isn't there an easier way?
I'm trapped.
Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at least he's letting me stay in the play. He won't be able to make, make it. He's in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.
Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone at least four days. I don't think he'll make the show, but I think he'll let me stay with it. ""Keep up the school work."" Thanks.Neil picks up his books and leaves.
I can't, guys.
But that's ten more years. Father, that's a lifetime!
I've got to tell you what I feel.Mrs. Perry stands up.
Nothing.Neil sits back down dejectedly.
I was good. I was really good.Mrs. Perry nods slightly.
","Rumor has it, you did summer school.
Keen.The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who isjust entering.
Meeks. Door. Closed.
Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study group.
Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?
That's not my fault.Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.
Charlie Dalton.Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.
Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar.
It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a genius like Meeks.
And English, and Trig.Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quicklystamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smokefrom the air.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.
Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.
Because he's in a hurry.
Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?
(still annoyed by what the coach said) What?
Ooh!
I'll second that.
How was dinner?
How was dinner?
Why? What happened?
That guy could eat a football.
Did you see her naked?
Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.
Tonight?
Don't go.
So don't come, please.
No shit, Sherlock.
I'm in.
Pitsie, come on.
Except sex.
What about you Knox?
Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.
Women swoon.Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.
Well, why don't you stay home?
Arrr, I'm a dead poet.
(laughing) Guys, over here.
God, are you trying to smoke us out of here?
I'll second that.
All right, intermission. Dig deep right here. Right here, lay it down
Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.
Don't keep anything back either. You guys are always bumming my smokes.Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongstthe pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, anorange, and half a roll.
Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?
Come on.
Ha!
The thing with the hand-All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on theroof of the car.
I told you that one.
When were you in six, last year?As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from thebook.
You want to hear a real poem?Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.
All right? No, I don't need it. You take it.
I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.
Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more wit. I, chief professor, am of it.Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he isreading.
The god of love, if such a thing there be, may learn to love from me.Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.
Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.
Meeks, Meeks.
To feel taller.
Give it to me! Give it to me!
""To indeed be a god!""
Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. Good for you. Neil enters his room with Todd and sits down at his typewriter.
Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply.
Really? Mine's got thirty.
Come on, Knox. Join in.
What's wrong?
Knock it off. Smoke your pipes.
What do you say we start this meeting?
Gentlemen, ""Poetrusic"" by Charles Dalton.Charlie begins playing erratic notes on the sexophone.
Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. Gotta do more. Gotta be more. Charlie plays more erratic sounds.
Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta do more! Gotta be more!Charlie starts to play a real tune on the saxophone.
My parents made me take the clarinet for years.
I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone is more sonorous.
Knoxious, you've gotta calm down.
What are you gonna do?
Yes. Say, yes.
At Chet Danburry's house.
Well?
So, you don't really think she means you're going with her?
What is the point?
Yeah?
Exercising the right not to walk.
Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in. It's my cave. Watch your step.
Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and--
Tina. This is the pledge class of the Dead Poets Society.
Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's Friday night. Let's get on with the meeting.The boys move aside to let the girls in.
Guys, I have an announcement to make. In keeping with the spirit of passionate experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From now on, call me Nuwanda.
We gonna have a meeting or what?
""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate.""
I made that up just for you.
I'll write one for you too, Gloria. She walks in beauty like the night. She walks in beauty like the night. Of cloudless climes and starry skies. All that's best, dark and bright, Meet in her aspect and her eyes.
There's plenty more where that came from.
That's part of what this club is about. In fact, I'd like to announce I published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets.
Demanding girls be admitted to Welton.
(whispering to Meeks) So we can all stop beating off.
I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
Are we just playing around out here, or do we mean what we say? For all we do is come together and reach a bunch of poems to each other. What the hell are we doing?
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little neck? If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.
Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just a moment.Charlie stands up, holding a phone and bell in his hands.
Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's God. He says we should have girls at Welton.Most of the students laugh while the boys from the cave all shaketheir heads in disbelief.
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
No.
I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.Charlie smiles and then shuts his door.
Creak. He started walking around towards my left. Creak. Creak. ""Assume the position, Mr. Dalton.""The door opens and Keating walks in. Many of the boys get up fromtheir seats.
Mr. Keating.
You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
But I thought you'd like that.
Yeah. Like what?
Aye, aye, Captain.
All right. Go on.
Get out of here. Cameron, you fool.Charlie notices Knox and grabs his jacket.
Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to her?
Nothing. What do you mean, nothing?
What did she say? I know she had to say something.
It's an Indian warrior symbol for virility. Makes me feel potent, like it can drive girls crazy.Charlie buttons up his shirt as everyone prepares to leave.
Yeah, come on, guys.Charlie hustles the boys away. Meeks remains staring at her. Charliereturns to drag him away.
Hey, there he is! Hey, hey.Cameron shoves him back into his seat.
(whispering) He's good. He's really good.Keating gives a thumbs up.
Neil, Neil, you were great.
Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on.
Is it okay if we walk back? Captain?Charlie motions Todd to follow.
Knox.The boys leave and Keating continues to stare after the car, wipingthe falling snow from his face.
Todd? Todd.Todd, still half asleep, tries to shrug him off.
Neil's dead.
Todd. It's okay, Todd.
It's all right, Todd.
It's all right. It's alright.Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it.
No!
Todd.
Leave him be.The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river,yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himselfand walks in silence out onto the dock.
You told him about this meeting?
That's it, guys. We're all fried.
Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office right now, finking.
The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The board of directors, the trustees and Mr. Nolan. Do you think for one moment they're gonna let this thing just blow over? Schools go down because of things like this. They need a scapegoat.The door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to puttheir cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes onand Cameron enters.
You finked, didn't you, Cameron?Charlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away.
You told Nolan everything about the club is what I'm talking about.
You little-Charlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back.
He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, so he rattled to save himself.
I'm out anyway!
What's that mean? Who are they after?
Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is that what they're saying?
","Hey, how's it going Neil?
Knox Overstreet.
Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.
All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?
Yeah, come along pal.Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.
Hey Spaz, Spaz.Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paperwhile Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.
Spooky if you ask me.
I can't make it guys. I have to have dinner at the Danburry's house.
Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in their nineties or something.
Yeah we'll see.Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at thefloor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention.
Ready to go sir.
Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.
This is the Danburry's, right?
Mrs. Danburry?Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her.
Yes.
Nice to meet you sir.
He's great. He just did a big case for GM.
Huh?
Terrible. Awful.He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys.
Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl in my entire life.
She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.
Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie, it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in love with such a jerk.
I can't just forget her Cameron. And I can't think about trig.The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a highpitched hum.
Very funny Dalton.
What's the Dead Poets Society?
You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry?
I don't know Charlie.
Yeah? How?
But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me why they swoon. Charlie!
Yuck.
An original piece.
Morose?
Great, Neil.
(quietly) ""To Chris.""Charlie looks up from his desk with a grin.
I see a sweetness in her smile. Blight light shines from her eyes. But life is complete; contentment is mine, Just knowing that...Several students begin to snicker.
just knowing that she's alive.Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk.
Sorry, Captain. It's stupid.
That's not funny.
I can't take it anymore. If I don't have Chris, I'm gonna kill myself.
No, Charlie. That's just my problem. I've been calm all my life. I'll do something about that.
I'm gonna call her.Knox begins to chuckle as he leaves the cave. The othersquickly grab their coats to follow him. Charlie goes back toplaying noise on his saxophone again.
She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will hate me. My parents will kill me. All right, goddamn it. You're right. ""Carpe diem."" Even if it kills me. Knox puts in another coin and calls again.
Hello, Chris?
Hi. This is Knox Overstreet.
She's glad I called.
Would I like to come to a party?
Well, sure.
Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris.
Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. Thank you.
Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.
Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna call me. She invited me to a party with her.
Yeah.
So?
Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's not the point. That's not the point at all.
The point, Charlie, is, uh--
that she was thinking about me. I've only met her once, and already she's thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to be mine. Carpe. Carpe!Knox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks awayand climbs the stairs.
Hello? Hello, Chris?Knox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror. Chris comesrunning out from one of the rooms.
Hi.
No. Chris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walkstoward the stairs.
But I--
No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, guys.
Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink--
To Mutt.They each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps,loosening his tie to try and breathe.
I don't really know Mutt.
To Mighty Mutt.They raise their glasses again for a toast and down the restof their glasses.
Will do.Bubba puts on a horned football helmet and walks away.
God help me.Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris.
Carpe diem.Knox takes a last swig of his drink and then begins to softly run hisfingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead.Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on.
Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but you've gotta-Chet throws himself at Knox, hurling them both to the floor. Hethen straddles Knox and begins to punch at him as Knox simplytries to protect himself.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Chris!He approaches a girl with hair similar to Chris' and turns her around,only to realize that it's not her.
Chris Noel. Do you know where she is?
Thanks.Chris is at her locker talking to a friend. She just closes her lockeras she notices Knox coming towards her. She turns away.
Excuse me. Chris.
I came to apologize for the other night. I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you.Chris pulls him aside, out of the main hallway.
I can't care. I love you, Chris.
Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. Please, accept these. Please.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.As Knox begins to read his poem, the classroom grows quiet aseveryone stops to listen.
The heavens made a girl named Chris With hair and skin of gold. To touch her would be paradise.Chris holds her head in her hands in embarrassment.
Yeah.The boys begin to get all excited but Charlie shushes them.
Nothing.
Nothing. But I did it.Knox walks away down the hall and the others chase after him.
Seize the day!
Chris.Knox leaves the other boys to join her.
What are you doing here?
Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up.
Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they catch you, we're both gonna be in big trouble.
I didn't mean to make a fool out of you.
I can't, Chris. I love you.
Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Are you going with him?
Then come with me.
Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come with me tonight. And then, if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
He won't know anything. We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Dead Poets Honor.
My word.Chris walks away from him and then turns to face him.
Yeah, Neil!The curtain closes again and Neil turns around, letting out anexcited sigh. Various actors continue to congratulate him. Neillets out a yell as he walks offstage. In the audience, while othersare leaving, Mr. Perry approaches a woman.
Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and you're out.
You don't know that, not yet.
O Captain! My Captain!
","Thank you.Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.
Todd Anderson.
My brother went here.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I wanna do.
No.
Yes, but-
Keating said that everybody took turns reading and I don't want to do that.
N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil, I just- I just don't want to do it, okay?
That's not how it works.
What? What are you gonna do, go up and ask them?Neil shrugs.
No. No, Neil.
Neil, Neil!Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whisperingagain.
You found what?
""A Midsummer Night's Dream""?
What is this?
I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have to do with you?
Yes, so?Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,wearing it like a cloak.
Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition and didn't even tell him?
Well, that's impossible.
Well, why don't you just call him and ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes.
Yeah, but if he said--
I don't know. Maybe.
W-What is that supposed to mean?
So- You want me out?
Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this concern, but I-I'm not like you. All right? You, you, you say thing and people listen. I'm, I'm not like that.
No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not the point. The, the, the point is that there's nothing you can do about it, so you can just butt out. I can take care of myself just fine. All right?
What do you mean, ""no""? A smile comes to Neil's face.
Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping frombed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back.
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
You're not gonna write it.
Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy. Neil begins typing.
I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem.
A yawp?
(quietly) Yawp.
(quietly) Yawp.
Yawp.
(shouting) Yawp!
A m-m-madman.
A c-crazy madman.
Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman.
Uh, I-I close my eyes.
Uh, and this image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
H-His hands reach out and choke me.
And, and all the time he's mumbling.
M-Mumbling, ""Truth. Truth is like, like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold."" The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keatingquickly gestures for him to close them again.
Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. You kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, it will just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream. Todd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clapand cheer.
Hey.
Nothing. Today's my birthday.
Thanks.
My parents gave me this. Neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to Todd, still inits wrappings.
Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing as last year.
Oh.
Maybe they weren't thinking about anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is about this is I, I didn't even like it the first time.
Or a car.
Oh, my!
Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss Neil's entrance.
W-What is that?
Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are waiting.
Neil! Neil!Outside of the crowd, Keating manages to catch up to Neil. He takeshold of Neil's coat.
Oh, Charlie.Todd opens his eyes and sees Charlie's face
What is it?Todd looks over to see Pitts, Meeks, and Knox by the door.
It's so beautiful.Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting intothe snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him.
He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it.
It was his father!
He wouldn't have left us. It's because he- He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his father did it.
His father killed him. He made him do it.
That is not true, Cameron. You know that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil loved acting.
Meeks?
What happened to Nuwanda?
What'd you tell 'em?
Mom.THe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowingwhat to do.
Yes, sir.Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before himbefore removing his glasses once more.
What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?
Uh, in the, in the Pr-
In the, in the, in the Pritchard?
Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign it. Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.
You gotta believe me. It's true.
But it wasn't his fault!
O Captain! My Captain!
","Neil, study group tonight?
Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new kid. Looks like a stiff!He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.
Oops!Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd entersthe room and sets his luggage down on his bed.
Brain damage.The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom andout the door without a word. The students look around at one another,uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.
Think he'll test us on that stuff?
What? What?
Big alumns. How'd you swing that?
Just replace these numbers here with ""x"", for ""x"" and ""y"".
Of course, so what's the problem?Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning upagainst it heavily.
Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and try and figure out problem five.
We shouldn't be doing this.
(reading from the annual) Man most likely to do anything.
What?The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.Neil stands up.
Wait a minute.
Sounds boring to me.
You know how many de-merits we're talking Dalton
Look, all I'm saying is that we have to be careful, we can't get caught.
Come on Neil, Hager's right-
Me too.
I mean as long as we're careful.The boys run into the building.
I don't know, it's starting to sound dangerous.
On the mud? We're gonna put our food on the mud?
I've got one that's even better than that.
I do. There's a young, married couple, and they're driving through the forest at night on a long trip. And they run out of gas, and there's a madman on the-
I love that story.
You did not. I got that in camp in sixth grade.
Where did you get that?
What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You see this chemistry-Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands andsuddenly all three of them are racing around the room.
Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be immature. Come on. I need my- Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.
Let me have my book, I need my- The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossingCameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and beginsblowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set ofbongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch.
I love the clarinet.
Ooh.
Oh, my God!
What?
Well, don't you think they're gonna figure out who wrote it? They're gonna come to you and ask to know what the Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had no right to do something like that.
Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so cute.Cameron runs a comb through his hair and Todd tries to mess it up.
Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix this.
Getting red? What does that mean?
So, Charlie, what's this ""getting red"" bit?Charlie opens his unbuttoned shirt to show a large red lightning boltpainted down his chest.
What's going on, guys?
Finked? I didn't know what the hell you're talking about.
Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, there's something called an honor code at this school, all right? If a teacher asks you a question, you tell the truth or you're expelled.
He's right there, Charlie. And if you guys are smart, you will do exactly what I did and cooperate. They're not after us. We're the victims. Us and Neil.
Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The ""Captain"" himself. I mean, you guys didn't really think he could avoid responsibility, did you?
Well, who else do you think, dumb ass? The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap, didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, Neil would be cozied up in his room right now, studying his chemistry and dreaming of being called doctor.
Believe what you want, but I say let Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?Charlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face.Cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameronlifts a hand to his bloody nose.
You just signed your expulsion papers, Nuwanda.Cameron rises to his feet.
And if the rest of you are smart, you'll do exactly what I did. They know everything anyway. You can't save Keating, but you can save yourselves.Cameron walks away, closing the door behind him.
We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered the Romantics and some of the chapters on Post Civil War literature.
I believe we skipped most of that, sir.
That page has been ripped out, sir.
They're all ripped out, sir.
Sir, we, uh-
""Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) How artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2)...""The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses.
""... How important is that objective? Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; question 2 rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter. If the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph--""Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of theclassroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.
