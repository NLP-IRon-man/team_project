txt,"Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life. She is the underside of life.
We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
But, Bishop...
I lied.
Bishop... (a last-ditch attempt)
(very calm) What is your full name? Your Christian name?
Your name?
Enough joking.
Very well.
St. Anne's?
You were unhappy?
The reason?
I see.
(very stern) Sit down.
Sit. Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother Superior.
Miss Van Cartier.
Your cigarette -- out. Christy inspects her cigarette. Page 24.
(ruefully) It has come to pass.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope. Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs. (staring at Christy's outfit) Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
And all those like you.
Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.
Check your driver's license. Christy stands, facing off with Mother Superior.
(suspiciously gracious) Of course. But it's almost lunch. Page 25.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to change
Would you like that? Mother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and tosses them down a chute marked ""INCINERATOR.""
Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola. There are three vows that every nun must accept. The vow of poverty...
The vow of obedience.
And the vow of chastity.
Good afternoon, Sisters. I apologize for my tardiness. I would like you to welcome a new member of our order, Sister Mary Clarence. ANGLE on SISTER MARY ROBERT, the nun standing beside Christy. Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but very sweet. She has only been at the convent a few years; she wears the simpler habit of a novice. She sneaks a look at Christy. Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring at her hands.
Mary Clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent. She is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways. Everyone sits, including Christy. SISTER MARY PATRICK, a nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. Mary Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
(reluctantly) Very well. Mary Clarence, rise please. Christy stands up slowly, aghast.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Until sundown. Page 29.
And Mary Clarence? Christy looks up.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
(taking away Christy's plate) No food. Not until sundown. ANGLE on Christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching the other nuns eat.
Yes. Until breakfast.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Your cell. Your room.
Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.
Useless distractions.
And whom would you call?
(not amused) Your cell is more than adequate.
It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.
I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof.
From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
If you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself. God has brought you here. Take the hint. Mother Superior leaves. After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one small window in her cell. She leans her head against the wall. She is trying not to think about what Mother Superior has said. Still, the mess her life has become overwhelms her. She fights back tears.
Sister Mary Patrick?
I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood?
(to Mary Patrick) Come, Sister. Mother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom. Christy now stands at the front of the room. She is visibly uncomfortable.
A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
This is a convent, not a clinic. We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
We are nuns. We seek solutions through prayer. Page 42.
You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a wastrel youth. He said, ""Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment.""
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. ""No pain, no gain."" Mother Superior smiles in a rather evil manner.
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on. Mother Superior gestures to the loom. Christy sits at the loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit. Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face. She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's instructions. She cracks her knuckles, as if she were about to play the piano. She grabs two parts of the loom, at random. She moves these parts. ANGLE on the loom. As a result of Christy's movements, the loom collapses, piece by piece. The tapestry unravels, the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Yes -- thank you so much. Page 57
(not amused and not looking up) I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
(smiling) You're my Olympic event.
(in triumph) The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the gold.
Good morning, Sisters. Mother Superior takes one more glance around, then leaves. Now that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, quietly, to the rhythm of the machine.
Gospel. A jazz solo on the organ. What next? Jesus goes to Rio? Good Friday-a- go-go? What were you thinking? Page 71.
And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.
Through blasphemy? You have corrupted the entire choir!
Out of the question.
And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir. Christy is crestfallen. There is a KNOCK on the door, and O'Hara enters. The other members of the choir are in behind him like sardines.
Oh?
Well... thank you. Page 72.
Perhaps.
Really? Christy has just been eating this up with a spoon.
(confused by the turn things have taken) Really...
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
That is indeed glorious news, Bishop. We will be honored to appear.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program? All the nuns look at one another. Then, slowly, one by one, they all raise their hands. Mother Superior is pure steel at this moment; her expression betrays no emotion. Christy, on the other hand, is quite confused.
The majority has spoken. Page 84.
I am certain the presentation will be a great success. Congratulations, Mary Clarence. And congratulations to you all. The nuns cheer, and cluster around Christy, chattering about the upcoming concert, as Mother Superior strides off.
You have a phone call. Mother Superior continues with her paperwork as Christy picks up the phone.
Really. Well, that makes two of us.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
I must go where I can be of use.
Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence.
Good day. Christy, frustrated, leaves the room. Mother Superior looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her choices.
What's wrong?
The rehearsal room! Mother Superior looks alarmed as Eddie takes the stairs two at a time.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together. Clapping his hands briskly, the FLOOR DIRECTOR suddenly steps forward from behind the TV cameras and hustles the choir away from the altar.
She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.
She isn't a nun. Her real name is Christy Van Cartier, and she is a professional entertainer. She witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent. The nuns all react with shock and emotion.
Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.
All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada. All the nuns hurriedly cross themselves.
Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell him the situation. Everyone else -- follow me. Mother Superior leads the way out the door.
Emergency! Open up! The Driver opens the door.
The San Francisco airport! Immediately! The nuns are all zooming past the Driver, onto the bus.
Young man! Page 102. The voice has a powerful ring of authority to it, and the Manager looks around.
We are nuns. We pray.
We pray for good things. Food for the hungry.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Come, Sisters. Let's go to chapel. Bring your beads. The nuns begin to leave.
And Gommorah. The plane sets down at the Vegas airport. Mother Superior and the nuns climb out.
But where?
Stand back. (she strides into the road) Taxi!
Brace yourselves, Sisters. In unison, the nuns all cross themselves.
Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. Try to blend in. The nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for Christy. Page 110.
Saving you. Move! The nuns surround Christy and head through the crowd in a cluster. Joey and Vince pursue them from different directions. Just before they catch them, Mother Superior barks an order.
Break! The nuns split up, each taking a different direction. Vince and Joey look bewildered.
Sweetheart. Vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd again. Joey catches up with his nun, only to find it is Mary Patrick. The shell game has worked; Christy has escaped for the moment.
(with authority) I guarantee you, she is no broad. She is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. Katherine's Convent. She is a model of generosity, virtue and love. You have my word, gentlemen. She is a nun.
Oh?
I'm a Christian. Police pour into the room and gather up Joey, Willy and Vince. Eddie walks over to Christy and Mother Superior.
Very well. (she turns to Eddie) I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger. (sincerely, with a smile) Thank-you. Page 116. ANGLE on Christy, watching this. She grins.
Yes?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.
Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Don't push it. Christy and Mother Superior embrace.
","(half to Christy, half to the mirror) You are something else. Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.
What did who say?
You are so damn sexy.
How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
I want us to be together. Like people. Honest, decent people. In the eyes of God. Babe, today... I went to confession.
For the first time in I don't know how long. I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
(looking deep into her eyes) He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity. Vince kisses Christy's hands again and drops turns away and starts putting on his shoes.
You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?
(trying to calm her) We can still see each other. Just like always. It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Babe, it's not me! I love you! It's God!
You're upset. I understand. I should go. I hate to. Page 5. A CLOCK-RADIO hits the wall beside Vince's head.
I'll call. Vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to Christy. He leaves. Christy is left standing on the bed, holding a particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl. With Vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed animal. She is caught between tears and rage.
Ernie Schmidt. How long you been with us, Ernie Schmidt?
Ernie, you know what's important to me? What counts? It's not all this. This is '-- what? Frosting. Loyalty. That's me, Ernie. That's home. Vince gestures to Joey, who takes out a revolver and points it at Ernie's head.
You ain't been loyal, Ernie. What did you tell the cops? Ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer to his temple. Page 11.
Joey? Joey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun.
Who else, Ernie? Who else was in on it?
(dropping Ernie's head in disgust) Why am I wasting my time?
Do it. (to Joey) ANGLE on the door to the office, which opens. Christy appears, with the mink coat in her arms.
Babe. (icy calm) Christy tries to speak; she can't.
Christy. Is there a problem? With the coat? Christy glances around the room; she doesn't move. She quickly sizes up the situation. She tries to appear matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen.
Yes?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten.
That's my girl. My girl in mink. Will you be home? Soon? Christy kisses Vince, quickly.
Maybe. (considering this)
She did. (making a decision) Bring her back. Now. For a talk.
(icy) Take care of it. With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy.
They grilled me for six hours in there. And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell were you?
He's so damn cocky. This is different.
You know so much. They've got Christy, and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it to every contact we got. Larry covers his ears with both hands.
Keep the message vague, but let 'em know. The price has gone up. Christy Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million. Dead or nearby. Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.
(very seductive) Baby, you know I do... of course... I feel it too... I'm blushing... can you hold? A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it. Vince meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved in a second romantic call.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
Can you hold? Can you try? Willy passes the phone to Vince. t Page 43
Have you found out where Christy is yet? Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want to try making it on a cop's salary? Find her, and find her now! Vince passes the phone back to Willy.
Raise the ante to three hundred grand. Willy heads for the fax machine. Vince regains his composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button.
Sorry, baby... you are? Totally? Not a stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... inside...
What? Nuns? You got me in here to see nuns? Isn't there a ball game on or something? Vince turns away from the TV just as a closeup of Christy appears on the screen.
This is it. Get ready to move. No mistakes. Grab her, get her to the Moonlight. We meet there, and we take care of her. (into phone) We're on it. Give me the address. Vince begins to write down the address.
(turning on the charm) Babe. Christy does not reply.
Babe, what happened here? Look at you.
What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
(kneeling by Christy) I love you, Chris. I always will. I gave you so much. My time. My affection. A big-time career. And how do you repay me? What's the thanks I get? Where's the loyalty, huh? Where's the love?
What do you mean -- judged? I don't get judged, baby.
And who are you to talk? You were nothing. You couldn't even sing. I must have been out of my mind.
She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Who gives a damn? Waste her. Joey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of the room.
It's done?
(disturbed) What's the problem?
Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's Christy. She's a babe!
It didn't happen.
I can't believe this. Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
Well?
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
So, take it off.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
Get her!
The nun! Vince, Joey and Willy each pick a nun and follow her. Vince catches up to a nun, whom we only see from the rear. He grabs her shoulder.
Babe. The nun spins around; it is Mother Superior.
There she is!
She's heading for the lounge! Go! Vince, Joey and Willy head for the lounge. Across the room, Eddie sees Christy and the cluster of nuns head through the glass doors. He barks into his walkie-talkie.
Willy -- hit the lights.
Find 'em! Willy moves off to find the light switch. There is a flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs.
(aiming) No -- there! And a third flash of fabric near the stage.
Freeze! Everybody! Page 114. The nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding Christy.
Joey?
Joey -- do it.
She's a broad! Got it! Just some broad! Mother Superior steps forward.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
","Come on, we're late.
It's after five. We have to bathe.
Is this like your old convent?
(not speaking above a whisper)
I... I brought you something.
An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard. Mary Robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown bread. Christy takes it..
(until almost whispering) Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.
Three years. Sister.
A novice.
(still sobbing) You have to help me
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out! I want to get in?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.
What?
(desperate) Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
Are you sure? Another BLAST OF MUSIC from the street. Christy turns to the crucifix. She gets confirmation.
(looking around cautiously) Are you sure this is what Reverend Mother had in mind? Page 51.
(shocked) Mary Clarence!
We need experience.
Experience! Right?
(to the waitress, confidentially) I have to do this. So I can become a nun.
Really? Page 53
Who are all these people?
(standing up) I am. Page 54.
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church?
(giggling) Mary Clarence! You're so... different from the other sisters. Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!
Mary Clarence! Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for the gun. Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING down the metal steps to the landing below. Christy shoves Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and follows her in.
Oh my Lord!
What was all that? Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
We could have been killed! But you saved me! (throwing her arms around Christy) Thank you, Mary Clarence! The door to the convent swings open. Mother Superior is waiting.
Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood. Mary Lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at Christy.
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
What?
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Oh my! Page 64.
(thrilled and disconcerted) That was exciting!
(to Christy) Do you really think we could do it? Get better?
(rapping)
(to the Dealer) We're nuns!
He's a carpenter. Page 81
He's decent.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
It's better than springtime.
It's brought people back to the church.
It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother. You'll see.
(delighted) Ice cream!
A thank-you? For what? You're the one we should be thanking.
Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
(worried) Are you leaving us?
The Council of Cardinals! I'm so nervous! What if I forget the words?
It's here! Let's go! Everyone makes a final check of their appearance, and then the group leaves the room to head for the bus. Mary Robert and Mary Patrick are the last to leave, except for Christy.
It's no use. She just isn't here. Page 93.
We can't sing without her! What should we do?
I don't understand. Where is she?
You're here! Thank goodness!
Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
Again? Revived Willy lunges for Mary Robert and grabs her. The two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the alley. Page 98.
But what do they want? Where are we going?
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
An... entertainer?
But... but... she was such a wonderful nun.
Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her!
Reverend Mother, I know that you and Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but -- we've got to help her.
She said they were from her old convent.
We're nuns! The Manager starts back toward his office.
Lawsuits.
And what a lovely name. Las Vegas...
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
A Benedictine. The CROUPIER and the players stare at the two nuns.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Not a note.
(afraid Christy will curse) Mary Clarence!
Reverend Mother?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final vows?
","From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo- lang.
I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your birthday . When we were seeing each other.
So I don't shop.
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a hooker!
Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' better class of people. Vince Laflocca.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
I'm going. My regards to Vince, And the Mrs. Christy hurls a jar of cold cream at Eddie's head. He ducks, and the jar hits the door.
Ladies. Eddie leaves. Christy is standing, absolutely furious.
You couldn't believe it? Vince the Prince?
What did you expect? Vince is as dirty as they come. We've been finding bodies around here for years.
He didn't do you a favor.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
But you'd have to agree to testify. The whole nine yards.
Then-you run.
Then one day they find you.
You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.
(to Tate) Get a stenographer. Page 18. Tate leaves. Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now.
Maybe Hawaii.
Maybe Armani.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don't even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you. Eddie smiles. Christy doesn't like the sound of this at all a Page 19.
Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here? As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait of St. Katherine. Christy shudders.
It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Vince has put out a contract on you. A hundred grand. You've seen him in action. Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's telling the truth.
And one bullet. That's all it's gonna take.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent. Nobody knows you're here but me. We're trying to get a quick court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Pray. (smiling) From inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn -- horribly. The voices don't blend, and individual notes are real migraine material. Christy looks aghast. Eddie urges her into a corridor, and she follows.
Aces. Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner? The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office.
One month, two tops. Behave yourself.
So long, Vince. See you soon. Page 30. Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him. Eddie drives off, chuckling.
Jesus. Data-base hoods. It's a wonderful world. (reading the fax sheet) Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so. Dead or alive.
Where's who?
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
Not again. You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Calm down. Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
I just need a few more weeks,
Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch. As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters. Christy takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. She sings as she works.
You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back.
She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. (urging her) Go. Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door. She looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in. She finally does.
What if I was Vince? You'd be dead right now. What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Listen to yourself. This isn't a career opportunity.
Jesus, look at you You're glowing.
Yeah. You look... great. I mean it..
I've been worried about you. Eddie sits on the bed beside Christy.
No -- worried about you. Personally. Page 79.
Me too.
No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed.
You re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different... Eddie and Christy are gazing into each other's eyes; they are just about to kiss. Their lips are less than an inch apart.
You're... you're a nun. Eddie and Christy jump apart, their intimacy has frightened them both, particularly given Christy's outfit, and their location.
Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I get all the way down to my car, and, of course -- where are the keys? Page 89.
You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch! Clarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he can hit Tate.
Get him out of here! Downstairs, in the cell! I want his ass locked up now! Nobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two detectives drag Tate away. Eddie grabs Tate's phone and dials long distance.
Clarkson, get on the other line. Call Frisco Central. Tell 'em to get two squad cars outside St. Katherine's convent, and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near the place. Clarkson dials quickly. Eddie listens to Tate's telephone as it RINGS and RINGS and RINGS.
Reverend Mother! Quick! Where's Christy?
They know she's here! They're on their way! Mother Superior points up the stairs.
Vince knows you're here.
Long story. His goons will be here any minute. We've got to get you out of here '- now! Christy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes. Eddie opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her tracks.
What?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here! Eddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly to the car.
I think they'd understand.
They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what? Moral guidance? Make-up tips?
(goading her) Nuns? Page 94.
What're you doing?
Where is she?
(to Clarkson) Close off the block, but don't move in till I tell you. Eddie jumps out of the car and hurries inside.
Move in. Seal off the exits, but don't come inside till I tell you.
Move in -- now!
Don't you have a concert to go to?
I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
","Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's. ANGLE on Christy, looking thoroughly disgusted. Page 28.
As part of our welcome, I've had a little thought, just for fun. Could we have our new friend offer today's blessing? ANGLE on the nuns, watching Christy.
(sincerely) Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
Which convent was that, Sister?
I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes?
1961? '62? Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows. It's the last secular music we recall.
Good afternoon, young ladies. And welcome to our Christian Youth Group. The Girls make grunting noises.
Hi. I hope we'll have some fun, and maybe learn a little something, too. Now, today's topic is something very up-to- date -- ""Teenage Promiscuity."" My. Now, can anyone tell me -- just what is promiscuity? ANGLE on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their eyes. Page 38
Anyone? Yes? Mary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants. a bustier and a leather baseball cap. Her name is Lawanda.
(blushing) Well, yes. That is one way to put it. Mother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by Christy
Yes?
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a loom?
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours.
Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. (as she deftly works the loom) You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear?
You betcha.
Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your heddles.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - Page 45.
Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell. Christy spots Mary Robert.
(eagerly) Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a choirmistress?
Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... (to Christy) Could you help us?
(puzzled) Chops?
We did it! We actually sang a chord!
Two days. An hour or so.
Oh, please? Can't we try? Christy and Mary Lazarus look at each other, as real comrades. Christy leans on Mary Lazarus' shoulder.
I know. It's ancient.
The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a girl. Of course. (singing)
Am I? There is a murmur from all the other nuns -- ""Oh, yes.
(as a confession) All right, I am, I know it! All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic. Perky. I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, ""That child is pure sunshine. She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess.""
(with real joy)
Bless her! There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. That's why many of us became nuns. It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
(rapping)
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
(to cruising cars) Free prayers right over here! Drive up and get your prayers!
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
What is it, Mary?
He's not like other guys.
He's kind.
This is so exhilarating! All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
It's better than ice cream.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
It should be here any minute.
Hurry, Sister!
Mary Clarence! Sister!
It doesn't make any sense. She was right behind me... The HORN on the school bus blows loudly down in the street.
(calming herself) We'll pray -- and she'll be there. The nuns are calmed by the tone of Mary Patrick's voice. They leave the room to join the others on the bus.
We sound terrible We need Mary Clarence.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She wasn't a nun?
Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully.
She's our inspiration!
We've got to save her!
She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.
But we don't have fifteen hundred!
Peace on Earth.
Measles.
It's so beautiful...
Look! There she is! Mary Patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos. The center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel, the Elvis impersonator, and Christy and the Ronelles. The bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the Moonlight Casino and Lounge.
But how do we get there? Page 107.
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
(smiling) Christy. Page 115.
Impossible. Mary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she has laryngitis. All the other nuns imitate her.
(to Christy) I just realized -- this is the last time we'll all be together. We're going to miss you so much. Page 117. Christy and Mary Patrick embrace. Mary Patrick is tearful.
