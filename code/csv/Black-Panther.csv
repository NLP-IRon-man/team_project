txt,"No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone . Okoye pauses, then returns her spear to the wall . T'Challa closes the model and steps to a marked circle in the floor.

What are you talking about? I never freeze.
Nakia . . . I . . . I wanted to ...
My father is dead , Nakia. The news devastates her .

This never gets old .
So surprised my little sister came to see me off before our big day .
Update? No, it worked perfectly .
I cannot wait to see what kind of update you make to your ceremonial outfit. Shuri flips him off .
How are you feeling today, mama?

I AM PRINCE T'CHALLA SO OF King
Yield! Don't make me kill you .
What would the proud Jabari do without you? T'Challa tightens further.
Yield, man ! M' Baku grudgingly reaches out and TAPS. T'Cha l la lets him go and is barely ab l e to stand h i mself as Zuri steps forward . The crowd ERUPTS as struggling to catch his breath , T'Challa proud l y lifts his ar m.
Zuri .
Wakanda forever !! The arena ECHOES THE PHRASE emphatically .
Baba!
I am sorry .

That is not what I am talking about . I am not ready to be without you.
Never .
He was there ! He was there . My father.
Corne home , Nakia .
Stay.
What would you have Wakanda do about it? Nakia thinks for a bit .
If you were not so stubborn you would make such a great queen.
Is that him? Glory to Bast, man, is he still growing?
Nakia thinks we should be doing more .
Foreign aid ... refugee programs. W'Kabi shakes his head.
But waging war on other countries has never been our way . Then , both of their Kimoyo beads buzz.
Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him was perhaps my father's greatest regret . I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial .
I need you here protecting the border.
You have my word I will bring him back.
Stop it. Stop it. Shuri laughs and they do a special handshake before walking down the spiral walkway into her sprawling, futuristic lab.
Okoye. And Nakia as well. Shuri makes a face at Nakia .
Yes . We'll be fine .
And what are these?
What , you don't like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day .
Interesting ·.·
Old ... ? Functional, but old . Eh , people are shooting at me .. . wait let me put on my helmet . . . T'Challa smiles, amused .
Enough .. .
Tempting . But the idea is to not be noticed . This one . Shuri uses her Kimoyo beads to sync the suit to T'Challa.
Anywhere?
You told me to strike it, you didn't say how hard . Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the same spot .
Well maybe you should make it a little stronger , eh? Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit GLOWING INDIGO where the impact of T'Challa's foot landed. T'Challa looks closely at the glowing script .
Wait a minute .
Very nice.
You are recording?
Delete that footage ...
The woman outside -- what trouble was she referring to? She plays along, alluring .

Agent Ross .
You are buying from Klaue ...
I gave you Zemo.
I am not here to make a deal . Ross rolls his eyes .
And the vibranium.
Stand down . We can't afford a shoot- out.

Shuri !
Keep go in g ! Panther uses his claws to make a sharp turn and avoid the wreck .
Don't worry about it . You're doing great . Panther leaps back onto the hood of the Lexus and they speed off . I/e . KLAUE'S 4RUNNER SPEAR STREET - NIGHT
Pull around the truck .
Faster , Shuri .

Did you think we would forget !? Klaue laughs .
Look at me murderer ! Where did you get this weapon?

After your questioning , we will to take him back to Wakanda with us . Ross stares at T'Challa for a beat .
--Agent Ross .
I do appreciate your help in Busan .
Okoye! Play nice.
And you believe the word of an arms dealer , strapped to a chair. Ross hesitates , but doesn ' t bite .
Give me a Kimoyo bead . T'Challa looks at Nakia and motions towards her Kimoyo bead. She pulls one off and hands it to him . T'Challa inserts it into Ross' wound.
This will stabilize him for now .
Give him to us . We can save him.
I am well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die knowing we can save him.
He's not here . T'Challa's eyes lower regretfully .
What happened to my Uncle N'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared ... there was a man today wearing a ring identical to this one . Zuri turns back and T'Challa lifts his hand, showing his VIBRANIUMRING from CA: CW . zuri turns away uncomfortable.
That is not your choice to make. What happened to him?
I am your King now! Zuri looks up.
No . ·.
No no no no no no . . .
And the child ...
He didn ' t even give him a proper burial ... My Uncle N'Jobu betrayed us , but my father may have created something even worse .
Did he reveal anything about his identity?

I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are ... now what do you want?
And what tools are those?
Our our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world . It is not our way to be judge jury and executioner for people who are not our own .
I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you. The elders murmur at Killmonger's disrespect. They wait to see how T'Challa will respond . Then , Ramonda suddenly speaks .
No.
Take him away.
I accept your challenge. W'Kabi looks at T'Challa closely .
This is your last chance, thro w down your weapons and we can handle this another way.
Zuri , no .
Nol Zuri no! Zuri!! Noo! Fueled by rage, T'Challa lifts back up to his feet. He charges Killmonger , who ducks his attacks, while talking to the audience .

Why, Baba?
You were wrong to abandon him .
You were wrong ! All of you were wrong ! To turn your backs on the rest of the world . We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right . No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne . He is a monster of our own making . I must take the mantle back , I must. I must right these wrongs . T'Chaka looks at his son , his disappointment giving way to a proud smile .
Do you have a blanket? They embrace. T'Challa turns to see Nakia and Shuri as well. The four of them embrace as M'Baku looks on .
Our resources . The Great Mound.
The challenge will have to continue .
Could you give me and Lord M' Baku a moment? Everyone exits and M'Baku gazes at T'Challa .
Thank you.
Please allow my mother to stay here .
You know I could use an army as well.
It is our cause . It is for all of us .
I cannot speak for past Kings . But an enemy sits on the throne right now. We both know the power of vibraniurn . If Killmonger gets control of it, who do you think he will come for next? M'Baku sits .
N'Jadakalll !
I never yielded, and as you can see, I am not dead .

W'Kabi stop this ! Stop this now ! W Kabi runs on top of a large ' rock to ga i n a vantage point , and pulls out a large HORN .
Shuri I! The DOG PILE is LAU NCHED off through the air !
Shuri !
Turn on the train on the bottom track!
Neither will he.
You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much? Divide and conquer the land as they did?
You have become them . You will destroy the world, Wakanda included .
Maybe we can still heal you . Killmonger thinks on this .
Thank you. You saved me. You saved my family . Our nation.
You can't blame me I almost died . Nakia looks at him deeply, and kisses him back.
Stay . I think I know a way you can still fulfill your calling. Please stay. Nakia looks at T' Challa with curious eyes. She kisses him .
This is where our father killed our uncle. Shuri looks at T'Challa, shocked by his bluntness. She turns and stares closely at the building. We see her POV of large SIGNAGE that hints that the building is soon to be demolished .
They're not tearing it down . . . I bought this building. Shuri turns to him confused .
Nakia will oversee the social outreach ... And you will spearhead the science and information exchange . Shuri turns to T'Challa in shock at what this means.
My name is King T'Challa , son of King T'Chaka . I am the sovereign ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and for the first time in our history we will be sharing our knowledge and resources with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows . We cannot , we must not. We will work to be an example of how we as brothers and sisters on this Earth should treat each other . Now more than ever , illusions of division threaten our very e x istence. We all know the truth : more connects us than separates us . In times of crisis , the wise build bridges , while the foolish build barriers . We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe . The audience of WORLD LEADERS look around , bemused, wondering what Wakanda could possibly have to offer .

The pickup's driver climbs out , cocking a submachine gun and looks into the forest in the wrong direction . Slowly approaching , the militant leader points to SHIFTING FOLIAGE in the direction of Panther. The militants nod and the militant leader covers them while they go off into the grass. The militants move slowly following every sound . They point their guns at the base of a TREE, but it ' s just a stray DOG. The gunmen approach the tree, eyeing around , then look up to find PANTHERstalking his prey from the tree tops.


Slipping behind a MILITANT, Nakia picks up the man's RIFLE and quickly disassembles it as another MILITANT approaches and using the BARRELlike a combat stick, puts him on his back , out cold. She leaps onto a second militant, easily taking him down and striking him in the throat.

Klaue looks back as Nakia closes in . The driver f l oors it as a GUNMAN the in THIRD SUV opens fire on Nakia's Lexus. The bullets carom off the hood .
Nakia and Okoye ... unfazed by the gunfire .
Okoye slides out the passenger window and climbs onto the roof, stabbing her short spear into the top of the vehicle as a handle , her dress blowing in the wind .

Klaue is back inside the SUV as it WEAVES through traffic. Then , we spot a rapidly closing LEXUS LC WITH PANTHERon the roof.
Klaue ' s 4Runner and Panther's LC make left turns, booking down a short road , then make quick rights.
Agents and CIA analysts move about. On the table sits KLAUE'S PROSTHETIC WEAPON and THE VIBRANIUMsitting atop the paper bag .
T'Challa and Okoye secretly listen to Klaue's interrogation .
ROSS exits the interrogation room and approaches T'Challa and Okoye.

Ross studies T'Challa .

Shuri activates a button on her Kimoyo beads .
As our heroes fight , the Border Tribesmen continue to use their advanced shields to close them off into an impenetrable circle . Okoye looks around, searching for an option for escape through the sea of Border Tribesmen . We find W' Kabi in the distance perched atop M20 looking back at her .
","This one is just a boy . .. he got kidnapped as well. Nakia pulls the wrap from the young militant's face , exposing his pre-teen expression. She removes her own hijab as well. Panther stares at her- for a beat too long ...
Why are you here? Eesh, you ruined my mission !
Carry yourselves home now , and take the boy . Get him to his people . The Nigerian Woman nods .
Queen Mother . . . Princess . My comfort for your loss.
I'm right here .
I came to support you , and to honor your father. But I can't stay. It's just ... ! found my calling out there . I've seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye . I can't be happy here knowing that there's people out there who have nothing . T'Challa thinks on this .
Share what we have. We could provide aid and access to technology and refuge to those who need it ... other countries do it, we do it better.
Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time . Nakia gives T'Challa a look .
I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn .
. .· if that's what I wanted !
Ah, I got into a disagreement with some ivory traders . Made a bit of a mess .
Depends on how quickly we finish the mission ...

Eyes up . Americans . I count ... three . We see Nakia's POV as she makes out THREE CIA AGENTSon the first floor, spread out under the balcony.
I don't see it yet .
We need to move on Klaue.
It's now or never . Nakia continues towards the CIA agent.
Do we just leave him?
Which one is he in now?
What are you doing?
Eesh . Nakia drops back and weaves through traffic as Okoye , engages her SPEAR MECHANISM,then steadies herself and let's her long spear fly , launching the weapon like a javelin.

There he is ! Hold tight !


He just jumped in front of me. Gravely wounded, Ross is barely conscious .
I don't think he'll make it here, it hit his spine .
He took a bullet for me.
So now we are just supposed to let him die?
No man is perfect . Not even your father.
Hey . Look at me. You can't let your father ' s mistakes define who you are . You get to decide what kind of King you are going to be. They share a look as T'C ha l la's Kimoyo beads buzz .
I locked him in the office . He's not going anywhere.
Get up .
What ...
We cannot turn over our nation to a man who showed up here only hours ago .
He killed T ' Challa .
Does that really matter? Okoye quiets .
You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has . Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong . Okoye stares at Nakia in disbelief.
I loved him. I love my country too .
No. I save my country . Nakia takes off.
The King is dead . Come with me, unless you want to join him . Ross's heart sinks as . . .
It's me.
He's a friend of T ' Challa's he saved my life . Ramonda studies Ross , then looks to Nakia.
Okoye is not corning . She and Dora Milaje will serve the new King.
We're taking the Heart Shaped Herb to Jabariland .
It's what made T'Challa so strong . Ramonda stops in her tracks.
I'm a spy with no army . I wouldn't stand a chance .
Stay calm .
Yes, but . . .
Great Gorilla M'Baku. This is why we are here. To offer this to you. An outsider s i ts on our throne. Only you can help us stop him . M'Baku considers . His ego stroked. But .. .
Impossible .

Wake up, T'Challa . Wake up .
Killmonger has the full support of our military . And he burned the garden of the Heart Shaped Herb.
As will I. T'Challa smiles he looks to Nakia and Ramonda who looks back at him with confidence .
I'm not a Dora.
We're counting on you!
Wakanda Forever !! He moves towards them with rage in his eyes . He engages Shuri and Nakia in battle , Nakia holds her own with her advanced ringblades while Shuri strafes from the side with her panther gaunt l ets-- shooting Killmonger from a distance .
I'm ok . You?
Let's go . They join the fight with Okoye and Ayo.
There is nothing to thank me for. It is our duty to . .. it was my duty to fight for what I love . I should
","Your highness . Ross plays it cool .
What I'm doing or not doing on behalf of the US government is of none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you're up to , do me a favor and stay out of my way.
And didn't I kept it under wraps that the King of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit. I ' d say we were even . Ross places a Pass bet. T'Challa dumps a stack of chips on Don't Pass. All of the SHOOTER'S FRIENDS blow on the dice.
You really need to leave, now. They watch the dice roll . They land on 3. The dea l er takes away Ross' bet , and slides T'Challa's massive payout over to him .
(to the empty chair) Hey, you won . Ross scratches his brow as a THIRSTY GAMBLER(Stan Lee) who was sitting next to T'Challa grabs them . Ross eyes the Thirsty Gambler who shrugs .

Alright , vibranium from the attack on Sokovia links back to a person that I'm not actually saying I'm here to make a deal with but that deal will not be called off. When the dust settles you and I can work something out .
Well that is quite the entourage . You got a mixtape coming out? Klaue cuts Ross a look .
Please don't make me listen to your music . I just meant , you got a lot of people with yo u.
Ok, that's enough. A CIA AGENTwalks a FANCYSLIM BRIEFCASE towards Ross.
The vibranium? Klaue looks around , and reaches into his pants and pulls out a wrinkled, sweaty paper bag, with ""FRAGILE"" written on it with a sharpie . Ross looks at the bag.
Hop in . Put that spear in the trunk .
Come on guys , let's go huh? T'Challa eyes around. He has little choice and nods.
So, this is a big mess, huh? I figured we can go good cop bad cop . I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in -- Okoye turns to T'Challa .
What? No. Look I like you, a lot. But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere . Listen , I 'm doing you a favor by letting you even be in here. Ross reaches out and touches T'Challa . Okoye steps in.
Does she speak English?
I'm going in . And when I'm done, you guys are up.
Yea. T'Challa puts his hand on Ross's shoulder .
You see that? It's called diplomacy . You're welcome. Ross walks through the door, closing it behind him .
I don't trust anybody, not in this job . But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there. Where'd you get that?
Why don't you give me the name of your supplier and I'll ask them.
T' Challa? You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda? Klaue nods.
Shepherds . Textiles . Cool outfits. Ross stops as we notice a MICRO AUDIO BUG on his shoulder that T'Challa planted before he entered the room .
Vibranium yea . Strongest metal on Earth.
Weapons?
That's a nice fairy tale but Wakanda is a third world country and you stole all their vibranium .
Your father to l d the UN that Klaue stole all the vibraniurn you had . But now he's telling me you have more?
How much more are you hiding? Then suddenly . . . Nakia SLAMSthrough the door . CIA AGENTS draw their weapons. Nakia is unfazed.
Alright, where am I? Startled, Shuri spins .
Colon-who? My name is Everett .
Right. Groggy, Ross gazes around at the completely unique technology .
Ok, is this Wakanda?
... How long ago was Korea?
I don't think so . Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.
These train things ... that's magnetic levitation, right?
Obviously ... but I've never seen it this efficient . The light panels, what are they?
Sonic what?

He's not a Wakandan . He's one of ours.
Eric Stevens . Graduated Annapolis age 19 . MIT for grad school . Joined the SEALs and went to Afghanistan where he racked up confirmed kills like it was a video game . They him Killmonger . He
What's wrong? Nakia tosses the blanket to Ross.
So where are we going again?
Heart Shaped Herb , what is that?
Look uh, your highness, the new King is a -- M'Baku drowns out Ross' voice with loud barks. The surrounding Jabari follow suit .

Of course he did . The T'Challa turns to Ross .
That's what he was trained to do. His unit used to work with the CIA to destabilize foreign countries .
I'm in too. The Wakandans cut Ross a look
What? You're gonna need all the help you can get. The Wakandans smile at Ross as M'Baku interrupts .
Ok, so what do I do? Shuri slips a kimoyo bead bracelet on Ross ' hand .
What?
You guys have hoverbikes? Shuri raises a sand table. She hurries back to the first table , grabs the gauntlets and points out some Dora armor .
Yea I don ' t know what I'm doing --
Alright , I'm on it .
Ok Shuri , I got 'em what do I do?
Alright ... Ross places his hands on the firing mechanism .
Here goes nothing . A RED TARGETINGCURSORpops up on the display . Ross reacts , then guides the cursor over the cargo ship, and fires !
Alright , I got 'em.
Oh shit shit shit .
Shuri, I've lost one of them but two are on my tail .
What the hell was that?
What? Where?
How long have I got?
Put me back in.
Shuril The last cargo ship is almost at the border , but they've got me trapped with some kind of cables .
Yes ! We did it !
","Let's give the lady some space please .
Hey come here. Come here! It ' s ok. You can go , but just don't tell anyone , alright? The SECURITY GUARDlooks back at him unsure, then takes off . Klaue then aims and shoots the Security Guard in the back . Killmonger looks on at him confused .
Because it's better to leave the crime scene more spread out . . . makes us look like amateurs . The LENS on a surveillance camera at the corner of the room looks on.
Now... let's see if you know what you're talking about .. . Klaue removes his glove to reveal a BIONIC PROSTHETIC hand .
Whoo ..· You 'r e gonna be rich , boy .
Oh it's already sold . Klaue waves Lirnbani over with the stretcher to load the hammer inside . He BREAKS the WOODEN HANDLEoff the tool , taking only the vibranium head .
That ' ll make my day . I can kill two birds with one stone . Lirnbani approaches Killmonger who eyes a third MASK e xpertly
You're not tel l ing me that's vibranium too , eh?
Yeah ! Yeah , actually there is one . Shocked , Ross is unsure if Kl aue is serious .
Yea I'll send you the soundcloud link if you like . Klaue turns to one of his goons .
Aye, Dave . Get him the link to the tape . The SOUTHAFRICAN TOUGHreaches into his pocket for his phone.
Oh, you think they're for you? Klaue laughs at this .
Don't worry . I can do a deal with you all by myself , thank you very much . He rubs Ross on the shoulder , hard , and for way too long . As several more SOUTHAFRICAN TOUGHScome pouring out of the VIP lounges .
You got the diamonds? Klaue is still rubbing Ross' shoulder .
I was going to buy a fancy suitcase, but I thought I'd save myself some money .
Get the diamonds, quick ! EVERYONE OF KLAUE'S TOUGHSunload, raining shells on the overturned craps table with Ross and T'Challa behind it . The TOUGHS move in only to have T'Challa leap from the table , staying low to FOOTSWEEP one onto his back . T'Challa kicks him back then disarms another TOUGHand kicks him into the bar . T'Challa then spins and kicks the next TOUGHover the roulette table and through the bar railing. Nakia grabs a goon in an ARMTWIST trying to relieve him of his gun . She takes off one shoe and knocks out another approaching gun. Swings the arm twisted goon to the floor, knocks him out, taking his gun and shooting up towards the balcony where Okoye is fighting .
You know, you look just like your old man. T'Challa snatches up a ROLLING CHANGECART TABLE just as Klaue fires the blaster at him . BOOOOM ! A COLOSSALSONIC BLAST hits the cart, !! blowing it to pieces and sending T'Challa FLYING THROUGH THE UPPER BALCONY RAILING back down into the pit . With money FLOATING in the air , T'Challa lands hard .
I made it rain!
That was awesome! That was awesome! Let's go ! Go, go , come on! Klaue jumps in the first of FOUR IDLING 4RUNNERS. The convoy instantly skids away as ... Nakia and Okoye emerge . Okoye throws an EMP bead from her pocket and it lands on a parked LEXUS LC.
Put some music on ! What do you think this is a funeral?


Oh shoot.
Right, let's have some fun . Sitting on the windowsill, Klaue aims his SONIC DISRUPTER.
Take a right , take a right !
You savages didn ' t deserve it . T'Challa grabs him by the throat and slams him into the SUV.

Hello! I can see you ! I can , I can see you.
You know, you really shouldn ' t trust the Wakandans. I'm much more your speed.
It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one if you'd like .
He's right outside , why don't you ask him yourself?
Bingo .
What do you actually know about Wakanda?
It's all a front . Explorers searched for it for centuries . El Dorado : The Golden City . They thought they could find it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time . A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man- Isipho- they call it . The gift . Vibranium ...
It's not just a metal ... They sew it into their clothes , it powers their city, their tech, their weapons ...
Oh yes . Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower .

All of it? I took a tiny piece of it . They have a mountain full of it. They've been mining it for thousands of years and still haven't scratched the surface .
I'm the only outsider who's seen it , and got out of there alive.
I see you took your time didn't you ! Killmonger continues to FIRE as Lirnbani and Linda hop in and begin to pull off.
I sell to the highest bidder . Don' t you worry when I get back to Jo- burg and lay low for a bit, I ' ll make sure both you guys get paid.
You don't wanna go there, boy .

... Y-You really wanna go to Wakanda? They're savages. Klaue shows his BRANDEDneck .
This is what they do to people like us.
You can sca r yourself as much as you like . To them , you'll just be an outsider. You're crazy to think that you could walk in there . Killmonger flips the inside of his bottom lip, revealing a glowing Wakandan TATTOO. Klaue can't believe his eyes .
And to think I saw you as some crazy Am erican .
