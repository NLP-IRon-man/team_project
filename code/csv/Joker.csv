--is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there? Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes. Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.
Yeah, I mean, it's different each day, so I really like that. I don't think I could ever work in an office. Behind a desk.
(beat) No offense.She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she'srunning late for her next appointment.
Everyday.
(dodging the subject) I'm sorry. Did I bring what?
Yes ma'am.Beat.
I've been using it as a journal, but also a joke diary. Funny thoughts or, or observations-- Did I tell you I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy?She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.
I think I did.
Right.ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat,angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcorepornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking athis right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm.His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot.
I didn't realize you wanted to read it.The social worker gives him a look, then reads something inthe pages that gives her pause.
Yeah. I mean, that's just--
No. I just,-- some of it's personal. You know?
She has good days. But mostly bad. It's been a big help having me there. She really needs me.
(nods) Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I was in the hospital, after my last episode-- she was having trouble getting over there to visit.She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her nextappointment.
Yeah, I was wondering if you could ask the doctor to increase the dosage on my medications? Nothing seems to make a difference.
(lying) Some. She glances at his file again.
I just don't wanna feel so bad anymore.

I wasn't bothering her, I was--
It's day to day. I'm doing everything I can to get her back on her feet. (re: pharmacy bag) Picked up her medicine. Gonna make her some dinner.
(calls out after her) Hey Sophie-- She turns around.
I'll tell my mom you said hello. She smiles as in ""yeah, that's what I said.""
Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.
Yes I'm sure. And my head's right here. I'm gonna make you some dinner, okay?
He's a busy man.
Ma, eat. You need to eat.
Maybe you shouldn't watch so much television.
(playful) Everybody who? Who do you talk to?
Stop it. He's not even gonna run. Why would Thomas Wayne want to be mayor? He can do more good as a businessman.
He will. Now eat some dinner.He feeds her a bite of the food.
How you feeling today?
(teasing) Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a werewolf?HE HOWLS SOFTLY like a wolf. She laughs.
What? Why?
Who tips their mailman?
Okay. I can try his office. Tomorrow.
Hello. I have a personal letter for Mr. Thomas Wayne.
It's kind of important. I need to make sure he gets it himself.
Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to work for the Wayne family-- for 12 years. She was their housekeeper. A couple other business people are now waiting behind Joker, there for meetings.
Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe at least call back to him? Tell him that I'm here.
Okay. Well, can I have your name? So I know who I left it with.
Wait. He's right there. (goes up to the glass, shouts) Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne. He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving. Not noticing him.
It was just a bunch of kids. I should have left it alone.Randall opens his locker--
(nods) My mother says that the people nowadays lack empathy.
It means like ""feeling for other people.""
Kind of. But different.Randall comes over, hands Joker a brown paper bag-- Jokerlooks inside. It's a GUN, a .38 snub-nose revolver. Joker looks up at him, confused--
I, I don't have the money for this, Randall.
What for?
Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to see me?
Not quite. Haven't even performed yet. Just been working my material. This business is all about fine- tuning. Now Hoyt looks up. Takes a drag from his cigarette.
No. I got jumped. I told you about that.
(voice tightens) I don't have his sign. And Joker just stares at Hoyt, some blood forming on his forehead--
They wouldn't let me see him. (lying) But they promised me it would get to him.
Look up. She tilts her head back and he rinses her hair with the water from the container...
Why are these letters so important to you, Ma? What do you think he's gonna do?
Help us how?
You worked for him over 30 years ago. What makes you think he would help you? She looks at him with conviction.
I don't want you worrying about money. Everyone's been telling me they think my stand-up is ready for the big clubs. It's just a matter of time before I get a break. She steps into the towel. He's helping dry her off.
What do you mean?
What?! He quickly turns up the TV volume. REALLY LOUD. Shoves the still smoking gun under the couch cushions.
I know. The Americans are really giving it to the Japs. He walks over to her in the darkness. Kisses her on the forehead.
(softly) I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.
Why didn't Randall tell me the gun was loaded? He's my friend. With my luck, I could have killed someone. (beat) I could have killed myself. CLOSE ON THE LAST LINE, he crosses out ""could""... Writes... ""should"".
(still to himself) I should have killed myself. CLOSE ON JOKER as he crosses out something again...
(louder to himself) I should kill myself. Beat.
Hello. I'd like to open an account. She looks up.
Oh, hi. That's weird. (pausing to see if he's gonna laugh; he's good) I didn't know you worked at a bank.
Very glamorous. Look at this place.She laughs.He stands there awkwardly for a moment looking around to seewhat she's laughing about.Realizes she thought he was making a joke.Beat.
I'm a comedian. I do stand-up comedy.
Yeah. You know, I'm always making funny observations. Always on the look out for my next bit-- so it makes sense.
I said hi to my mom.
Last week. You said to say hi to my mom. I did. Made her day.They are interrupted by the BRANCH MANAGER (50's), white,heavy-set, who has come up behind Sophie--
(covering; trying to act cool) Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you as well, Miss. Joker walks back to the wall by the forms. He fumbles around for a minute, clearly not there to open an account. He begins filling out a form. Then--
(shouts out, to no one in particular)
If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet. Joker and the kids stomp and sing along.
If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet. (stomp, stomp) If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it, if you're happy and you know it stomp your feet. As the song winds down, the KIDS and NURSES clap. Joker takes an exaggerated and ridiculous bow-- And as he does, his .38 SNUB-NOSE REVOLVER slips out of his pants and slides across the floor. Everyone stops. Looks at the gun on the floor.
(into phone) Hoyt, let me explain.
(into phone) It was, it was a prop gun. It's part of my act now.
(into phone) Randall told you that?
(into phone) Hoyt--
(into phone) Say what?
(into phone; low) --I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
(into phone; louder) I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
(shakes his head, stifling the laughter) Please. Don't.
Nothing. I have a condition--Joker reaches into his bag to get one of his ""Forgive mylaughter"" cards, the third guy sees him reaching and tries tograb the bag from him---Joker pulls on it--
No. It's just my stuff. I don't have anything.The guy rips the bag from his hand--
Hi. Do you like to laugh? Water dripping, white grease paint running off his face--
Remember how I told you that I'm a stand-up comedian? (again) Hi. How are you? Beat.
Hi. Do you like to laugh?
(continuing without taking a breath) Remember the other day when I told you about my stand-up comedy. Well, I'm doing a set next Thursday and I'm inviting a bunch of my friends and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come and check it out.
Were you crying? Why are you crying?Beat.
I'm sorry. I, I didn't--
What happened?
What for?
(finally) Okay. Well, all the info is right there on the flyer.He starts to walk away, then turns back to her--
You know they say laughter is the best medicine.Sophie wipes her eyes and manages a smile.
Well I didn't think you were going to read it.
I lied. Everything bothers me.
It's personal. It's my private thoughts. Plus it contains original comedy material that I don't feel comfortable handing over to you. She looks at him and shakes her head. Not in the mood to deal with this.
So where will we be meeting?
Okay.
How am I gonna get my medication? Beat.
Why are they talking to him?His mother shushes him. Joker sits on the end of the bed nextto her. It's one of those ""Good Morning, Gotham"" shows.
(trying to stop himself from laughing) -- good evening, hello. (deep breath; trying to stop laughing) Good to be here. (keeps cracking up) I, I hated school as a kid. But my mother would always say,-- (bad imitation of his mom, still laughing) ""You should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living."" (laughs) ""No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!"" Dead silence. Except for Joker, who's still cracking up.
So, did you laugh? Really couldn't see much from up there.Sophie pauses, doesn't know what to say. She lights up acigarette.
All I heard was my heart pounding.
What friends?
(he forgot; recovers) Yeah, I decided not to invite them. As a performer sometimes you want to see how a ""real"" crowd reacts. People who don't already love me, or, or have a notion of who I am, you know?
Yeah,-- I don't know how something like that happens.
You think?
(calls out to her) Hey. You want to get some coffee?Sophie turns around and smiles. She looks great, even infront of the mounds of garbage bags that line the sidewalk.AN AMBULANCE SCREAMS BY, SIRENS BLARING as Sophie sayssomething that Joker doesn't hear. She keeps walking.Joker chases after her and trips over a TIN GARBAGE CAN LID--CLANG. CLANG. He falls down flat on his face.Sophie turns and bursts out laughing. She can't help butlaugh. It's the first time she's laughed all night.
I don't know.
Not all of them are awful. Take someone like Thomas Wayne for example. He's a hero.
Sophie, he's the only one who can save this city.
What happened?
With your job. At the bank?
We don't have to talk about it. Beat.
Every time.
(thinks it over again) Every time. Sophie smiles.
(interrupting) Did you do it? Did you go to bed with him?
Right. Wait, what do you mean?
(catching his breath) I'm sorry. I have this thing--
I don't know. I read you can get it from a brain injury or, or a lesion in there. My mom said I was born this way. Born laughing.
Kind of. That actually started when I was a kid. The other kids made fun of me, called me Happy-- but not in a good way. I got so sick of it, one day when I was about ten,
I took a razor and cut this smile onto my face. (she's taken aback as he points to the scars) Sort of like ""You want happy? Here, how's this for happy?"" He looks down, still smiling. She just watches him for a beat.
I've been thinking about this night my whole life. They just sit there for a beat. Quiet.
(quietly) ""That's life.""He hears Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra playing the show'sclosing song-- the instrumental version of Frank Sinatra's""That's Life"".As the music continues, Joker puts his face up against hismom's nose, to see if she's breathing or if she's dead.He feels her breath against his cheek.Now he picks his mother up in his arms and carries her intoher bedroom to the music, almost as if he's dancing with heras he leaves the room...We stay behind.""That's Life"" still playing from TV.He comes back into the living room and turns off the TV.Takes off his jacket and throws it on the couch. Noticessomething sticking out of his jacket pocket. He pulls it out.It's the envelope he was supposed to deliver to Thomas Wayne.He stares at it for a beat. And then--Quietly rips it open, starts to read the letter:CLOSE ON WORDS, ""Dearest Thomas, I don't know where else toturn...""""Need your help...""""You have a son. We have a son. His name is Arthur.""Stops reading, stays on--""You have a son.""JOKER STARING DOWN AT THE LETTER, reading those words overand over again -- ""You have a son.""
What is this? How come you never told me?
How could you not tell me, Ma?
(raising his voice; excited)
Apparently I'm Thomas Wayne's son! How could you keep that from me?His mother slowly getting up out of bed.
(shouts after her) I'm not yelling! I'm just, excited. How can any of this be real!? How can Thomas Wayne be my father?
(lowers his voice; trying to sound calm) Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will you please talk to me?Joker leans in closer to the door. Leaning against it withjust his head--
Please.
(eyes still closed, head leaning against the door) What would they say, Ma?
It was a prop gun. And I didn't pull it out, it fell out.
Why don't you ask Randall about it? It was his idea.
What?
I don't know anything about it.
Randall, I didn't shoot anybody. That wasn't me. And I don't have time for this, I got somebody real important I gotta go see. Joker turns to go--
(turning back around) What?
What are you talking about?
Randall. Your nose.
My name's Arthur. I'm here to see Mr. Wayne--
I, I was just trying to make him laugh. He hands it back to Joker.
No, please. My mother's name is Penny Fleck. She used to work here, years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne that I need to see him?
Did you know her? Alfred doesn't say anything. Joker puts his face right up against the bars, whispers so the boy can't hear him--
You don't need to cover for them. I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset when she found out.
No. No, just let me speak to Mr. Wayne. Now Alfred leans in closer to Joker, almost looks like he feels some pity for him--
(blurts out) Thomas Wayne is my father-- Alfred looks at Joker, and can't help but crack up laughing at him. AND JOKER REACHES THROUGH THE BARS AND GRABS HIM. Pulls him in close, trying to choke him, still holding the wand of flowers in one hand-- AS HE CHOKES ALFRED, Joker sees little Bruce, wide-eyed in the shadows, looking out at him in horror. Joker stops. Lets go of Alfred... Takes off running back down the street away from Wayne Manor, magic wand in hand, leaving the rest of his clown gear behind.
You did this to her?
They told me she had a stroke.Beat.
(laughter choking up in his throat) No I,-- I have a, a--Tears rolling down his face, he takes out one of his cardsand hands it to Det. Burke. Burke glances over the card, askeptical look on his face.
I don't know anything about that.
Not for having a gun. That was prop gun. Part of my act.Joker's laughter finally stops for good.
They said I wasn't funny.The detectives share another look.
Now, if you don't mind, I have to go back and look after my mother. Detective Burke steps close to him, holds up the card that Joker handed him--
Clown thing?
What do you think? And Joker walks away-- heads for the sliding glass doors. Only the motion detector doesn't engage--
Excuse me, I was wondering how I could check my mother out of here? One of the nurses at the desk looks up at him, seems slightly annoyed.
Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her home.
She's not gonna wanna stay that long. She doesn't like hospitals. Or doctors.
I don't like hospitals either.Beat.The resident just nods okay. Looks down at his clipboard--
Okay. Thanks.He turns to go, but the resident continues--
Symptoms?
Can you tell me what those symptoms are again?
Excuse me?
No, sorry. Wasn't me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If I were you, I'd walk away from this table before I strangle all three of you with that fucking stethoscope hanging from your neck. Beat.
What? Yeah. No I, I--
Dad. It's me.Beat.But Thomas Wayne doesn't hear him, he was flushing theurinal. He walks toward the sink.
My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son. (beat) I know you didn't know about me, and I don't want anything from you. Well... maybe a hug.And Joker smiles, it's all very emotional for him. Thomaslooks over at him like he's fucking crazy.
Yes. But they wouldn't let me in, wouldn't let me see you. So I came here. I have so many questions.Thomas Wayne just laughs to himself and turns on the goldfaucets at one of the sinks.
How do you know?Thomas Wayne just keeps washing his hands, doesn't even lookover at Joker.
No. What? I wasn't adopted.Thomas starts drying his hands.
No. No, I don't believe that.Thomas finishes drying his hands. Turns to Joker, his toneway more serious now.
(tries shaking his head no; still laughing and choking) No, no I have a con--
Sophie? WALKS INTO THE DARK LIVING ROOM, catches a glimpse of Sophie, naked riding on top of SOME GUY on the couch-- The guy sees Joker standing in the shadows and jumps. Sophie turns and sees Joker as well. She screams--
Can I ask you a question? How does someone wind up in here? Have all these people committed crimes?
(nods; looks down) Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes I don't know what to do, y'know, I don't think I can take any more of this.The clerk is half listening as he scans the paper work.
Last time I ended up taking it out on some,-- people. Bad shit. I thought it would bother me but, it really hasn't.For the first time, the clerk looks at him--
It's just so hard to try and be happy all the time, y'know, when everything's going to shit all around you.
(backtracking) Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was just talking to talk.The clerk just nods. Finally finds what he was looking for.
(saying it out loud for himself to hear) So she was a patient here.The guy opens the file. Yellowing pages of her records--
What?
I can handle bad. I've been on a pretty bad run myself.The clerk puts the file down on his desk--
No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get through this, that's why I'm here.
I don't know. I mean I've never been with a woman ""like that,"" but, this feels like a beginning to me.
You what? What? What kind of woman are you? Who does that?Some of the other mothers turn toward them--
(shouts) Why not?GiGi runs up to Sophie's side to see what's going on, to seeif her mother's okay.
No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you need to hear this. Your mother's a bad person. She's a whore, she's seeing two men at once. You can't trust her,-- She'll break your fucking heart.Joker turns to go, behind him GiGi starts to cry. He's closeto tears himself.Sophie takes off after him, and reaches out and grabs him--Joker spins quickly around to face her, looks like he mighteven hit her--
How come nothing ever comes easy for me?And Sophie slaps him hard across the face-- Then turns andwalks away.CLOSE ON JOKER, he begins to laugh--
(into phone; skeptical) Who is this?
(into phone) Yes. Joker looks down at the cat purring at his feet, and kicks it away.
(into phone) Murray wants me to come on the show?
Ma, remember how you used to tell me that God gave me this laugh for a reason. That I had a purpose. To bring laughter and joy into this fucked up world,-- She looks at him confused.
HA! It wasn't God, it was you or, or one of your boyfriends,-- how could you let that happen? What kind of woman are you? What kind of mother are you? She looks away.
What's my real name? Her whole body is shaking, overwhelmed with emotion.
C'mon, Ma, I know I was adopted. What's my name? Who am I really? She looks back him, struggles to speak--
(interrupting, snaps at her)
Happy?! I'm not happy. I haven't been happy for one minute of my entire fucking life. He reaches behind her, grabs one of her pillows--
But you know what's funny? You know what really makes me laugh? Leans down closer, face-to-face with her--
I used to think my life was nothing but a tragedy, but now, now I realize it's all just a fucking comedy.
You wanna hear a joke, Murray? He ""waits"" for Murray to answer. Then Joker nods okay and opens his notebook--
(reading) Knock-knock. His cat still watching him, now at his feet. Joker crosses and uncrosses his legs... Looks uncomfortable. He glances down at his cat. It's as if he can hear the cat talking to him.
(nods; frustrated) Yeah, I don't know if I should cross or uncross 'em. Both feel completely unnatural. Joker gets up off the couch and walks back across the living room. Waves to the ""audience""... Mimes shaking Murray's hand... Mimes unbuttoning his coat and sits down... Crosses his legs.
Thanks for having me on, Murray. I can't tell you how much this means to me, it's been a life long dream. I have a joke for you-- Joker stands back up. Looks down at the cat again.
You're right. You're right, uncrossed is better. Joker sits back down... Doesn't cross his legs this time.
(wiping his eyes; restrained anger) You shouldn't be here. It's not right.
It's always been just me and her. Joker pauses for a moment, then starts to walk away.
You saw that?
Yeah, well I guess you didn't get the joke.
(interrupting) Which hospital?
I just buried my mother. The detectives share a look. Garrity pulls out a card. Hands it to Joker.
(looks down, reading the card) Right. Thanks for coming.
That was a joke. We hear applause followed by the familiar opening riff to ELTON JOHN'S ""Bennie & the Jets"".
Is that today?Randall looks at him and laughs--
My mom died.
(beat) It's not a good time. I'm in the middle of something here.
(catching his breath) I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you believe it? Gary doesn't answer. Doesn't move--
It's okay, Gary. You can go. Gary backs away toward the door. Joker sits there for a moment, breathing heavy, wipes Randall's blood off his face--
(shakes Murray's hand; effusive) Murray, I can't believe this is real, that I'm really here.
Are you kidding? Thank you for the opportunity. I've been watching you forever. My mother never missed a show.Murray nods not listening, he's heard this before.
No, I don't believe in any of that. I don't believe in anything. I just thought it would be good for my act.
No. I hadn't heard.Gene and Murray share a look.
Thank you Murray.
Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When you bring me out, can you introduce me as ""The Joker""?Murray and Gene look back at him
Honestly, I don't even know what my real name is.Joker smiles, the guys can't tell if he's kidding or not.
Besides, that's what you called me on the show, Murray. A joker. Remember?
(just nods, still laughing) Yeah. Isn't it great? Joker just keeps cracking up. Audience still isn't sure what to make of him. There's some awkward laughter.
(between laughs) That's right. I'm not political, Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to make people laugh.
(reading) Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.
(nods, reads it again) I want to get it right. Knock knock.Murray makes a face like, ""Okay, I'll go along with this.""
(looks up from his notebook) It's the police, ma'am. Your son has been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead.Beat.
That's right, Murray. But she's dead now. The audience laughs.
Yeah. She is. Murray's not sure if this is part of his act.
I don't know who my father is, Murray. Turns out I was adopted and sexually assaulted by my mother's boyfriend.A few in the audience groan. A couple even laugh. Still thinkit's just Joker's edgy, off-kilter sense of humor.Don Ellis plays ""wha-wha-wha-whuuuuh"" on his trumpet from theband stand.
(just keeps going, on a roll) Sorry. It's been a rough few months, Murray. I mean, after my mother died, the police came to question me at her funeral. Who does that?
Very funny, Murray. No, they came because I killed those three Wall Street guys.Beat.
There is no punchline. It's not a joke.
(shrugs) I got nothing left to lose, Murray. Nothing can hurt me anymore. This is my fate, it was always my fate. My life is nothing but a comedy.
C'mon, Murray, do I look like the kind of clown who could start a movement? I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody's awful these days. It's enough to make anyone crazy.
No. They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. Some audible groans from the audience.
Why is everyone so upset about these guys? Because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV?
Yeah. I do. Everything comes so easy for him.
Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray? Do you ever actually leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. You think men like Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever think what it's like to be a guy like me? To be anybody but themselves. (shaking his head, voice rising) They don't. They think we'll all just sit there and take it like good little boys. That we won't werewolf and go wild. Well, this is for all of you out there.Joker ""howls at the moon."" It's fucking weird.
You're awful, Murray. There is no more laughter. The audience is watching this exchange with full attention.
Playing my video, inviting me on the show,-- You just wanted to make fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh at Frankenstein on a crowded beach, isn't it? You're just like the rest of them, Murray. Everything comes too easy for you.
How about another joke, Murray? What do you get when you cross a mentally-ill loner with a system that abandons him and treats him like trash? Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker, suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He starts to turn to camera--
(pulls Randall's gun) I'll tell you what you get. You get what you fucking deserve,-- And as Murray Franklin turns back to him, JOKER SHOOTS THE
-- just thinking of this joke.
No.
Because it's personal, it's between me and him. Beat.
(nods yes)
Good. Everything's good now.
(beat) Yeah.
How I remember it.
","(annoyed) Jesus, Gene, I don't have time for this. Cindy's been breaking my balls all day.
Three marriages, you'd think I'da fuckin' learned something. (then) What do I gotta see? I already know he's a nut. That's why we're putting him on, it's a goof. A young BLONDE INTERN walks by in the opposite direction. She nervously smiles to them and keeps walking. Both men turn and check out her ass. Murray winks at Gene.
Oh shut up, Gene. (to Joker) Murray is fine. I prefer it in fact. Thanks for coming on the show.
So what's with the face? Are you part of the protests?
I like it. It's timely. It's edgy. It's, it's dangerous. The best comedy is all those things put together. (done) We're gonna go with it.Gene rubs his temples, he doesn't like this, but Murray isthe boss.
(flashes his bemused smile; condescending) Couple rules though,-- No cussing, no off-color material, we do a clean show, okay? You'll be on after Dr. Sally. Someone will come and get you. Good?Joker nods good. Smiles back at Murray.Murray and Gene turn to go, exchanging smirks with each otheras they walk out, making light of Joker who we see behindthem still standing there.
(to Gene; trying not to crack up) Did I?
(turns back to Joker) Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it is. Murray starts to laugh at Joker as he closes the dressing room door, shutting it right in his face.
(to Dr. Sally) You gotta see our next guest for yourself. Will you stick around? Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure he could use a doctor. The audience laughs.
He looks like he's got a lot of problems. Another big laugh.
(turns, looks into camera) It's been a crazy few days here in Gotham, and, I think maybe things are about to get crazy around here too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll be right back.
(looking into camera) O-kay, you may have seen that clip of our next guest when we first played it two weeks ago. Now before he comes out, I just want to say that we're all heartbroken here and sensitive to what's going on in the city tonight. But, this is how he wanted to come on the show. So let me introduce-- The Joker.
So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the show. But I gotta tell ya, with what happened at City Hall today, I'm sure many of our viewers here in the studio, and at home, might find this look of yours in poor taste.Joker's not listening to Murray. He's mesmerized by all thelights shining on him... all the eyes on him... he doesn'tanswer Murray.Nervous laughter from the audience.
(tries again) Can you tell us why you're dressed like this? AND JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. Not embarrassed of it anymore. He goes with it. Giving in to it, enjoying the laughter.
(can't help but smile at Joker's laughing) Okay. But I'm not sure how any of this is funny. A lot of those protesters are going with this look. City seems to be full of clowns these days.
(smiles; trying to save the interview) So when we talked earlier, you mentioned that you aren't political. That this look isn't a political statement.
(beat; smiles) How's that goin' for ya? Have you been working on any new material? Do you want to tell us a joke?The audience claps, egging Joker on to tell a joke.Joker looks over at Murray -- his laughing fit finallysubsiding -- and reaches into his jacket pocket and--Pulls out his worn notebook, catching his breath. Looksthrough it to find a new joke.
You brought a joke book?The audience laughs. Joker smiles, opens the page to BruceWayne's photo, pauses for a moment then turns the page. Findsa joke--
Oh god, a knock-knock joke? And you need to read it?
Who's there?
(bemused smile; patronizing) Right. Sorry. I mean Joker-- you told me backstage that your mother's a big fan of the show, that she never misses it. Joker puts the notebook back in his pocket. Crosses his legs, starting to get a bit more comfortable.
(goes along with the ""joke"") Hold on. Your mother's dead?
Okay. What about your father? Does he watch the show?Laughter from the crowd.
(shakes his head; irritated) Yeah, that's not funny, that's not the kind of humor we do on this show.Murray glances over at Gene in the wings. He gives him the""wrap it up"" sign.
(too easy) Oh really? Were you a suspect?The audience laughs.
(looks at him confused) Okay. I'm waiting for the punchline.
(turns back to Joker; with gravitas) You're serious, aren't you? You're telling us you killed those three boys on the subway. Why should we believe you?
(beat) Okay, I think I understand. You did it to start a movement, to become a symbol.
So that's it, you're crazy. That's your defense for killing three young men? Because they were mean to you?
You have a problem with Thomas Wayne, too?
And what's wrong with that?
Me? How am I awful?
(on the spot; defensive) You don't know the first thing about me, pal. Look what happened because of what you did, Arthur, what it led to. There are riots out there. Two policemen are in critical condition, someone was killed today.
","Thank you. (realizing) Of course it's you,-- everyone else in this building is just so fucking rude. Joker nods ""thanks."" Holds his breath, hoping he doesn't start to laugh. Floors dinging as the elevator rises. Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail behind her mom.
How's your mom doing? He takes a deep breath, he's uncomfortable talking to her, holds up the white prescription bag.
(smiles; being polite) She's lucky she has you-- Joker smiles thanks, can't help but glance at GiGi licking the rail. Sophie finally notices. She wants to grab her but can't with her hands full. Tries to kick her away--
Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How many times have I told you that? (to Joker) This building is so awful, isn't it? Joker just nods... he doesn't know what to say, but clearly wants to continue this conversation with Sophie. The doors open. They all step off.
Okay. Well, tell your mom I said hello. And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall-- the opposite way of Joker. He just stands there for a beat. Heart beating fast.
(surprised) Hey, what are you doing up here?
Pretty glamorous, right?Not getting the sarcasm, Joker nods. Looks around.
Really? I had no idea.
Right. Anyway, is there something I could help you with?Beat.
Excuse me?
Everything is fine Mr. Slotnick. Now he leans down and whispers something in her ear-- Joker just watches through the glass.
(shakes her head; to her manager) No. He's not. He's interested in opening an account.
What?
I had a bad day.
It's okay. How would you know.
I got fired. From the bank.Joker takes a deep breath and smiles without realizing it,hoping he doesn't start to laugh.
Because,-- I don't know. It doesn't fucking matter. I don't know what I'm gonna do.And she starts crying again. Joker doesn't move. Just standsin the doorway awkward.
Is that what they say?
(trying to be nice) Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear anything?
It was good. I really needed to get out of my apartment so, thanks. (beat) What happened to the rest of your friends?
Didn't you say some of your friends were coming?
(nodding) Yeah. I get that.Joker smiles at the connection. They walk past a newsstand--a wall of Chinese language newspapers mixed with local papers and tabloids, screaming headlines about the three Wall Street Guys gunned down on the train.Joker stops and stares at the headlines--
Please. I'll bet you five bucks those rich assholes deserved it.He turns to her.
Look at their faces. Those smug smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck them.Sophie flicks her cigarette away and starts walking.
The guy who did it is a hero. Three less pricks in Gotham City. Woo- hoo! Only a million more to go.Joker watches her walk for a beat.
--I'm telling you, it's across the board. Wall Street, the banks, politicians. They've been making a killing for years. Fuck them. Joker takes a moment to think about what she said.
What don't you know?
Oh c'mon, he's the worst! Joker is taken aback--
You can't be serious!? He's a complete narcissist. Brags about his money. Meanwhile, the rest of us can barely make rent. Or feed our kids. Joker nods. Thinking about it. Then--
With what?
(suddenly uncomfortable) Oh. Yeah, I was, um,--
Have you ever been fired before? Joker thinks it over for a moment.
And have you ever wanted to torch the place?
Right. And this was like the first good job I had in like, years. Not waitressing or anything like that. It was 9-5. I had benefits. You know what that means when you have a kid? Joker just looks at her, he doesn't really know what that means. He just smiles.
But from the very first day, the manager guy starts smiling at me, whispering in my ear, touching me, trying to get me to sleep with him--
Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig. So finally I complained to his boss, and they fired me... And now, now I don't know what to do with myself.
I finally felt good. Like I had a future. A purpose. And now I don't even know how I'm gonna pay my rent. AND JOKER STARTS LAUGHING. He puts a hand over his mouthtrying to cover it, but he can't stop cracking up--It's unsettling and disturbing for Sophie. People eating, waiters in red vests, busboys, all look over and stare at him. A few laugh. Joker turns away embarrassed, he looks out the plate-glass window, face turning red from laughing sohard--AS HE LOOKS OUT, HE SEES A GROUP OF ROWDY KIDS walking downthe street. One of them glances back before he turns thecorner-- HE'S WEARING A CLOWN MASK THAT LOOKS JUST JOKER'SCLOWN FACE. And then he's gone. The group disappears aroundthe corner--Joker can't believe his eyes, still laughing-- He turns toSophie who didn't see them. Just sits there awkwardly waitingfor it to stop.Finally, it subsides--
I know. Awkward beat.
How did you get it?
Is that why she calls you Happy?
What?
You okay?
What the hell was that? You can't just walk into my apartment like that. He is taken aback by her anger--
What are you talking about? What do you think this is?
Arthur, I was just being nice to you. I felt sorry for you. I have a boyfriend.
You need to leave. I'm not having this conversation with you.
(turns to her daughter) Go back with your friends, honey. Mommy's having a grown up talk.Before GiGi leaves Joker looks down at her--
","I heard about the beat down you took. Fucking savages.
It's crazy out there. And it's only getting worse.
What's empathy?
Like sympathy?
Take it. I got a few. You gotta protect yourself out there, buddy. Too many wackos.As Joker stares at it--
(lowers his voice) It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job done if you ever need to use it. Usually pulling it out is enough.
Don't sweat it. You can pay me some other time. You're my boy. That lands with Joker, he smiles to himself.
(as he walks away) But you didn't get it from me, okay? Joker nods. Puts the brown paper bag in his locker. Slowly starts to get dressed-- his eyes darting toward the bag as he does. Another clown, GARY (30's), a dwarf, pops his head into the locker room.
Yeah, Hoyt did you wrong, buddy. Doesn't seem fair.
What? I don't. Stop talking outta your ass, Art! (to the guys)
I think all his stupid laughing musta scrambled his brain or something. The guys laugh and keep jawing. Joker doesn't say anything. Just finishes packing his bag and closes his locker door--
(calling out) Art! Hold up,-- As he catches up with Joker his red nose falls off, but he's so out of breath he doesn't realize he lost it--
What the fuck was that about? Beat.
Why would you say that? That, that it was my idea. Joker just looks back at Randall. Sees his red Styrofoam nose bouncing down the alley behind him.
You don't get it, do you, buddy, that shit that went down on the subway, that's no joke. They got clown sketches on the front of every fucking paper. It's just a matter of time before the cops come around. Beat.
(leans in close; lowers his voice) Art, you know you're my boy. I'm not gonna say shit. I just hope you got rid of that gun. That can't come back on me, okay?
You know they're sellin' masks.
They're selling masks of your clown face,-- based off the description I guess. It's like a thing now.
There's a lot of people in this city who are happy you did what you did. If you did it.
What? Randall touches his face. Realizes his nose is not there. Joker points to Randall's clown nose tumbling back down the alley. And Randall hustles after it, chasing after his red nose blowing skipping away in the wind--
You must be goin' down to that rally at City Hall. Right? I hear it's gonna be nuts.
Yeah. What's with the clown-face then?Joker shuts the door behind them. Locks the chain-lock.
(nodding) Yeah we heard. That's why we're here. Figured you might wanna go out, get a drink or something? Joker doesn't answer. Awkward beat.
Yeah, we're family. We gotta stick together. Joker stares at Randall.
Yeah. Another time, then. Oh hey,-- one other thing-- He takes a step closer to Joker--
Listen, the cops have been poking around the shop, they're talking to all the clowns about those subway murders and--
(snaps at Gary) That's because the suspect was a regular-sized person. If it was a fucking midget you'd be in jail right now. (turns back to Joker) Anyway, Hoyt said they were looking for me, and, and I just wanna see what you said. You know, make sure our stories line up, bein' that you're my boy and-- AND JOKER STABS THE SCISSORS AS DEEP AS HE CAN into Randall's neck. Blood spurts. Randall screams. Gary stumbles back in shock--
","He must not be getting my letters.
Too busy for me? I worked for that family for 12 years. He always had a smile for me. Least he could do is write back.
You need to eat. Look how skinny you are.Before Joker can say anything, his mother points to the newson the TV--
All day long it's more bad news. That's all there is.
(ignoring) He's the only hope for Gotham. He'll make a great mayor. Everybody says so.
Well everybody on the news.
Because he cares about this city. And everyone in it-- that's why I can't believe he hasn't written me back.
I don't know. It always hits me worse at night, you notice that?He shakes his head.
It's not funny.Joker watches her as he cuts up some more of her food.
Anyway, I wrote a new letter today. A better one. I want you to hand deliver it to him.
Cause maybe the mailman is throwing them away. We should have tipped him at Christmas time.
Some people do. Rich people do.Joker sighs, resigned.
Thank you. (she pats the bed) Come sit. It's almost on. Joker gets into bed with her. CLOSE ON TELEVISION, intro to ""LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!"", and we HEAR THE ANNOUNCER over clips of comedy bits, stars and Murray Franklin himself--
--so what did he say when you gave him the letter?
It's good they promised. He only works with the best. We should hear something soon. He fills an empty plastic container with some bath water.
He's gonna help us.
Get us out of here, take me away from this place and these-- these awful people.
Because Thomas Wayne is a good man. If he knew how I was living, if he saw this place, it would make him sick. I can't explain it to you any better than that. Joker nods. Annoyed, but not worth the argument. He stands up to get her a towel.
Happy, what makes you think you could do that?
I mean, don't you have to be funny to be a comedian? Beat.
It's so loud.
They're interviewing him about those horrible murders on the subway last week.
You hear that! I told you. We're family.ANGLE ON TELEVISION, footage of GRAFFITI around the city.""KILL THE RICH"" spray painted on a storefront. ""F CK WALLSTREET"" written on a subway wall. ""RESIST"" scrawled across abillboard.
--what, what time is it? He doesn't answer.
What happened? Did you hurt yourself again? Joker holds her letter up in his hand.
Is, is that my letter? Is that my letter, Happy?
You told me you dropped it off. You have no right opening my mail. Who do you think you are?
Stop yelling at me, you're gonna kill me, give me a heart attack!She goes into the bathroom.
He didn't do anything to me. Or to my boy. Can I go now, I don't like hospitals. Dr. Stoner lays out the photographs in front of Penny-- Penny keeps smoking her cigarette, glances down at the photos, we catch glimpses of various bruises on parts of Joker's body... A filthy crib... A rope tied to the radiator...
That's not true. My apartment wasn't filthy. I keep a clean house. Joker just stares at his mother. Dr. Stoner looks at Penny, not sure how to respond to that.
I'm just glad I got to know him. Joker just keeps staring at her as she exhales-- JOKER BACK IN THE STAIRWELL LOOKS UP FROM THE FILE, looks like maybe there's cigarette smoke drifting in front of his face--
H-h-happ--
