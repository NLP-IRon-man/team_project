txt,"(singing) Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE
...Huh? Yeah?
No, you didn't. I've been up for hours.
Who is it?
Ready for what?
My sister's cor-neration... One eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress. She bolts, wide awake in excitement.
Coronation Day! Ha ha!
(google-eyed)
(frustrated) Hey!
(gentler) Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.
Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I was going. But I'm okay. He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.
I'm great, actually.
(curtseying) Princess Anna of Arendelle.
Hi...again. The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it. Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.
Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward, but just because we're-- I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. (did she just say that?) Wait, what? Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.
No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash! `Cuz, you know... (patting the horse) Hello.
(to Hans) But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.
...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I better go. I have to...I better go. She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.
Bye! As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.
Here? Are you sure? She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other.
Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.
Thank you. You look beautifuller. I mean, not fuller. You don't look fuller, but more beautiful.
It's warmer than I thought.
What?
Oh, I don't think-- The Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can protest.
Ow. Ow.
...No.
(rubbing her sore feet) Especially for a man in heels.
(loving Elsa's attention) I've never been better. This is so nice. I wish it could be like this all the time.
Why not? If--
Excuse me for a minute. She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened. Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches her. He smiles perfectly.
Hans. He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts her up and leads her in a romantic dance.
I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... Oops. Sorry. She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs.
...Your physique helps I'm sure.
I was born with it, although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll.
Yeah, the whole thing! You got it. They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face.
Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers?
That's horrible.
...And sisters. Elsa and I were really close when we were little. But then, one day she just shut me out, and I never knew why. He takes her hand. Leans in close.
Okay, can I just say something crazy?
(singing)
What?
Can I just say something even crazier? Yes.
Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there? Thank you. Oh, there she is. Elsa! Elsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly.
I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um. May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
We would like--
--of--
Yes!
Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. Of course we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream and then-- Wait. Would we live here?
Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us--
Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must--
Wait, what?
No. Whatever you have to say, you- you can say to both of us.
You can if it's true love.
More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.
What? Elsa, no. No, wait! Anna grabs Elsa's hand. She pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.
(desperate) Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore. Elsa fights tears.
(heartbroken) ...What did I ever do to you?! The party goes silent as everyone watches the sisters.
No. Why? Why do you shut me out?! Why do you shut the world out?! What are you so afraid of?!
Elsa...? Elsa rushes out of the room.
Elsa! Hans follows closely behind her. GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to the water's edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet. Anna calls to her from the gates.
Elsa! Wait, please! Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks into a run, as the water freezes over with each step.
Elsa, stop! Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls.
No.
(in shock) No.
No. Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright.
Wait, no! The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna.
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.
...And my sister's not a monster.
It was an accident. She was scared. She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this.... Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one that needs to go after her.
(to the Royal Handler) Bring me my horse, please.
Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right. The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak.
No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle. He sees the desperation in her eyes.
(to the crowd) I leave Prince Hans in charge!
She's my sister; she would never hurt me.
(shivering) Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault.
(hearing a wolf howl) Of course, none of this would have happened if she'd just told me her secret...ha...she's a stinker. A branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. Anna goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. She sits up. Spits out snow. Sees the horse running away.
Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No. No. No. No.... Oooo-kay. He doesn't come back. Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.
Snow, it had to be snow, she couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm -- She sees smoke rising up in the distance.
Fire! WHOA! Anna goes tumbling down the hill. She lands with a crash in an icy stream at the bottom.
(from inside the snowball) Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...
Wandering Oaken's Trading Post. Snow drops off a smaller sign. She reads it, happily.
Ooh! And Sauna...
Oh, great. For now, how about boots. Winter boots...and dresses?
Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has another young woman, the Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here? She brings the clothes and boots to the counter.
Huh?
Oh, right. Excuse me. Anna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the place, gathering other supplies.
(to herself) North Mountain. Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on his fingertips.
Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. I mean, that is really... (he shoots her a look) Ahem. That's unfortunate.
Okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the North Mountain? Did it seem magical? Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.
Nice duet. Kristoff sits up with a start...sees who it is.
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.
Let me rephrase that... A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.
Take me up the North Mountain.... Please. He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.
Look, I know how to stop this winter. He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.
Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't-- (catching herself) We leave now. Right now. She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed, Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff has a bite, contemplating.
(fearless) I like fast! Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.
(grossed out) Ew. No, I was raised in a castle. She wipes off her face.
...Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage--
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove--
Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.
Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a stranger.
...Of-the-Southern-Isles?
...Sandwiches.
Probably John.
Dreamy.
Foot size doesn't matter.
Picks his nose?
Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.
Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's true love.
Are you some sort of love expert?
You have friends who are love experts.... I'm not buying it. Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.
No, no, no. I'd like to meet these-- Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.
What are they?
Wolves. What do we do?
But I wanna help.
Why not?
Excuse me?! A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.
It's true love! He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a wolf away.
Christopher! Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.
Duck! Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.
But I didn't. Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.
Get ready to jump, Sven!
Pull, Sven! Pull! REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven. Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety. Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at the burning sled.
Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and everything in it. Kristoff groans.
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore. Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.
(excited) You are?! (catching herself) I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.
Arendelle.
...But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.
(uncertain) ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to the North Mountain? She points straight ahead.
I never knew winter could be so beautiful. Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that voice OLAF.
I don't want it!
Don't!
No! Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.
Ew, ew, the body! Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down. Olaf smiles happily, then looks confused.
(sympathetic) ...Okay. Wait one second. Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head.
You're welcome.
Well, almost. She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the way through his head.
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was just.... Are you okay? Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his eyes. He lights up.
Olaf?...That's right, Olaf.
Oh, um...I'm Anna.
That's Sven.
...Sven. Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused.
Olaf, did Elsa build you?
Do you know where she is?
Do you think you could show us the way?
Don't you dare.
(laughing) I'm coming! Sven hops along, happily following them. Kristoff watches all of them like they're nuts.
(confident) Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.
Yup. Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.
Why would I be?
What now?
(straining) ...I'm going to see my sister.
You mean the love experts?
...Please tell me I'm almost there. REVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake.
...Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here? Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her.
Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch! Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her.
Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise. She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off. Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck.
Whoa.
Go ahead. I won't judge. Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction. Kristoff runs to his aide.
Ha. It opened. That's a first. Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought, stops him.
You should probably wait out here.
Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.
You too, Olaf.
Just give us a minute.
Elsa? It's me...Anna?! Anna slips. Steadies herself.
Elsa, you look different.... It's a good different.... And this place is amazing.
...I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known-- Elsa backs up, away from Anna.
But I just got here.
So do you. Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more.
...Actually, about that--
He's just like the one we built as kids.... We were so close. We can be like that again. Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her.
Elsa, wait--
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again.
Yeah, but--
You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.
It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.
Sure you can. I know you can. Snow starts to swirl around the room.
I'm okay.... I'm fine. Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.
No, I know we can figure this out together--
(close to tears) No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.
Stop. Put us down!
Olaf!
It is not nice to throw people! Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.
I got him! Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.
It's a hundred foot drop.
Ow. He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the snow with a pick axe.
What's that for?
(not trusting) Okay. What if we fall?
Okay. You tell me when...
...I'm ready to go....
(pumped up) ...I was BORN ready! Yes!
Olaf!
Wait, what? Kristoff's head hits the cliff.
Kristoff!
(grossed out by his snow breath) Ugh. We won't. Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to just as they fall. They both SCREAM!
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow. She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's boots, which are sticking out of the snow.
(impressed) Whoa!
Thank you. They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?
...Um.... How's your head? She touches the spot where he banged his head.
(shy) Now what? (then...panicking) Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do? She threw me out. I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this. And then there's your ice business--
What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.
White? It's what?
Does it look bad?
(catching up) The love experts?
How do you know? He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls heal her as a child.
...A little. He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do, then gets a thought.
Oooh.... That's nice. They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.
(moved) They did?
Kristoff, they sound wonderful. Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.
(to herself) ...They're rocks.
Okay. Um...I'm gonna go-- Just then the rocks around her start rolling.
(panicking) Kristoff! Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff and unfold as trolls.
Trolls? They're trolls. Silence. All troll eyes turn to Anna. Blink. Blink.
What's going on?
Wait. Oh. Um. No.
Right. We're not. I'm not-- Anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.
Wait, what?!
What...? No.
An act of true love?
(still weak) ...Hans.
...Are you g-gonna be okay?
(weak, but desperate) Hans, you have to kiss me.
Now. Here we go. She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in his arms.
Elsa struck me with her powers.
I was wrong. Anna crumbles, weak.
(shivering more) She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.
What? Hans gets up, leaving her there.
...You said you did. He goes to the window and shuts the curtains.
What are you talking about?
Hans?
Hans. No, stop.
Please.
...You're no match for Elsa. He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time not so gently.
(anger) You won't get away with this. Hans rises and crosses to the door.
(hoarse and weak) Please, somebody help. The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the floor.
(barely a whisper) Help. CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.
Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.
Please Olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt.
I don't even know what love is.
...Kristoff loves me?
Olaf, you're melting.
...They-they are?
Help me up, Olaf. Please. He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the chess set and water jugs.
I need to get to Kristoff.
Kristoff! The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling off into the storm.
Kristoff!
(a whisper) Kristoff.
Elsa. Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him a longing look, but then turns away from him and then... Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.
No! In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out.
Oh, Elsa. They embrace.
(weak) ...I love you. Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--
Elsa?
I knew you could do it.
Uh. Uh. Uh. She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.
The only frozen heart around here is yours. She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! She runs him right into a pole.
Oops. Sorry.
(stopping) Okay. Okay. Here we are.
I owe you a sled.
Yes. And it's the latest model.
You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer. Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's king of the bucks.
Sure it is. And it even has a cup holder.... Do you like it?
We may.
I like the open gates.
What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't ska-- Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna slips and slides, but laughs in delight. Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.
","Ice?
What do you want, Sven? Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can.
What's the magic word?
Hey, hey, hey! Share! Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself, not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber. We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who rush towards the castle.
(in her face) Carrots.
Behind you.
The North Mountain.
Forty? No, ten.
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem? I sell ice for a living. Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of ice on his sled, covered in snow.
...Ten's all I got. Help me out.
Yes! Now, back up while I deal with this crook here. Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.
Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa! Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.
No Sven, I didn't get your carrots. Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees something. He points to a dilapidated barn.
But I did find us a place to sleep. And it's free.
Oh, it's just you. What do you want?
I don't take people places. He lays back down, closes his eyes.
Umph. He sits up. Looks in the bag.
We leave at dawn.... And you forgot the carrots for Sven. A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.
Ugh!
(trying to scare Anna) Hang on! We like to go fast!
Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down. He pushes her feet down.
This is fresh lacquer. Seriously, were you raised in a barn? Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back and hits Anna in the face.
So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?
Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?
Hang on. You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met?!
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers? Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.
Oh yeah? What's his last name?
What's his favorite food?
Best friend's name?
Eye color.
Foot size...?
Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose?
And eats it.
All men do it.
Doesn't sound like true love.
No. But I have friends who are.
(to Anna) Stop talking.
I mean it. SHHH. Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them. Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its light reflects off...EYES. Several.
Sven, go. Go! Sven takes off.
Wolves.
I've got this. You just...don't fall off and don't get eaten.
No.
Because I don't trust your judgement.
Who marries a man she just met? Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.
(shocked) Whoa. Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf. The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.
It's Kristoff!
You almost set me on fire! Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.
You don't tell him what to do! Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.
I do! Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness from the sled.
Jump, Sven! Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back. Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled. Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge. Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air. He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below and burst into flames.
(shocked sadness) ...But I just paid it off. Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.
Uh-oh. No, no, no. To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.
Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again.
(knowing he's got a point) ...You know sometimes I really don't like you. Sven licks Kristoff happily.
It's completely frozen.
Will she?
More like this way. He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.
You're creepy. Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a game of hot potato.
Backatchya!
Come on, it's just a head.
(studying the arm) Fascinating...
(bending the arm) How does this work? Olaf's dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.
I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to bring back summer.
Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
I'm gonna tell him.
Somebody's got to tell him.
So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?
That's your plan? My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister.
So you're not at all afraid of her?
...It's too steep. I've only got one rope, and you don't know how to climb mountains.
(finding her ridiculous) What are you doing?
You're going to kill yourself. Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds.
I wouldn't put my foot there.
Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?
You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone.
I'm not alone.... I have friends, remember? Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold.
Yes, the love experts! Anna realizes she's stuck.
Hang on. He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.
(in awe) Now that's ice. I might cry.
All right, take it easy. I gotcha. Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him.
You stay right here, buddy. Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details.
...Flawless. Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates.
What?
But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life.
Anna. Are you okay?
Anna, I think we should go.
Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!
This way! Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.
(impressed) Ho-ho-ho!
Whoa, stop!
It's two hundred. Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.
I'm digging a snow anchor.
There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.... Hopefully. They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.
Okay, Anna. On three. Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.
One...
Two...
Calm down. A huge tree flies through the air toward them.
Whoa! That happened. Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs and puffs, struggling to run.
Aargghh! Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.
Those are my legs. Olaf's bottom goes running by.
Don't talk to him like that. Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.
Here. He lifts her out easily.
You okay?
(in pain) Ah! Ooh! He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle.
I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good. Ha. I've got a thick skull.
...So.... The awkwardness is killing him.
(shy) Now what?
Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business... (noticing something) Worry about your hair?! She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.
No, yours is turning white. She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white.
It's because she struck you; isn't it?
(thinking) ...No. Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to join the conversation.
No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Now, come on.
To see my friends.
Yes. And don't worry; they'll be able to fix this.
...Because I've seen them do it before. As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven.
Are you cold?
Wait. Come here. He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock- lined pass. Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path. He holds her hands over one of them.
(taking a deep breath) So, about my friends...well, I say friends, they're more like family.... Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven...until they took me in.
(nervous ramble) Yeah. I don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate...and loud...very loud...they're also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy.
But they're fine.. You'll get it. They mean well. Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly.
Okay then.... Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave of the arms announces--
Meet my family. REVEAL: he's surrounded by rocks.
(to the rocks) Hey, guys! As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.
(holding up his pants) Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on, thank you.
Great to see you all. Where's grandpa?
I've learned to just roll with it. Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look at Anna. She studies her like she's a piece of cattle.
You've got the wrong idea. That's not why I brought her here.
Can we just stop talking about this?! We've got a real, actual problem here.
No, I don't.
(to the male trolls) Enough! She's engaged to someone else. Okay?! TROLLS beat. Blink. Blink. The boy trolls turn, huddle...
Anna? He pulls off her cape and hat.
She's as cold as ice. Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd. Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the pit.
Grand Pabbie!
So remove it, Grand Pabbie.
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.
Help us out, Sven. Kristoff grabs Sven's antlers. Sven pulls them out. Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.
Come on, Olaf! Sven takes off. Olaf grabs Sven's tail, rides with them.
Just hang in there. (to Sven) Come on, buddy, faster! They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them, out of control.
Stay out of sight, Olaf!
I've got you. Anna looks up at him, gratefully.
(touched, reassuring) Don't worry about me. Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid rush to help Anna.
Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately.
Make sure she's safe! Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him. Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with worry at the closed gates. Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly follows.
What is it, buddy? Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.
Hey, watch it. What's wrong with you? Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.
(avoiding) ...I don't understand you when you talk like that.
Ah! Stop it! Put me down! Sven drops him hard then ""yells"" at him once more.
No, Sven! We're not going back! Sven shakes his head, angrily.
She's with her true love. Sven makes an ""of-course-she-isn't"" face. Kristoff gets it; he's made his point. Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.
Anna. Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and jumps onto his back.
Come on, buddy, faster.
Come on! Come on! Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes over them. They give it all they've got as debris falls all around them and the mast shatters. They make it past just as the entire ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath their feet. The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing water and disappears below.
Sven? Sven! At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to go on.
Good boy.
Anna...? Anna!
Anna. Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is giving it all he's got. He's going to make it. But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he raises his sword over his head.
Pole.
(blown away) Are you serious?
No. I can't accept this...
What? That's not a thing. But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.
Like it? He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.
I love it.... I could kiss you! He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.
...I could. I mean I'd like to. I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may we? Wait, what? She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.
Look out. Reindeer coming through!
","It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna.
...Hi.
...You look beautiful.
Thank you. They look out at the celebration.
So, this is what a party looks like?
And what is that amazing smell? They both close their eyes and inhale.
(to the Duke) Thank you...only I don't dance.
But my sister does.
Sorry. OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but he's just awful. Anna tries to make the best of it.
Well, he was sprightly.
Are you okay?
(sincere) Me too.... But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away.
But it can't.
It just can't.
Marriage...?
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Here?
Anna--
What? No, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married.
May I talk to you, please. Alone. Anna sees Hans's worried face. Hooks arms with him.
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.
Anna, what do you know about true love?
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. Now, excuse me.
(flustered) No, you may not. And I-I think you should go. Elsa walks away. As she passes the Royal Handler--
The party is over. Close the gates.
Give me my glove! Anna holds the glove away from Elsa.
(weak) ...Then leave. Elsa sees Anna's hurt face. It's too much. She can't hold it in. She turns and rushes away.
Enough, Anna.
I said, enough!
(to the Duke) Please, just stay away from me. Stay away! Magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the staircase into ice. The thugs and the Duke fall.
(cautious, polite) Thank you, I never knew what I was capable of. Anna starts to climb the stairs.
(on guard) No, it's okay. You don't have to apologize.... But you should probably go, please.
...You belong in Arendelle.
No, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody.
Wait. What is that? Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves.
(shocked) Olaf? Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated.
(astonished) And you're alive?
No, we can't. Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps.
Goodbye, Anna.
(calling back) I'm just trying to protect you. Elsa continues to flee. Anna pursues.
Anna,
I know!
What? Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains.
Everywhere?
No, I can't. I don't know how.
(panicking)
(scared) Who's this? Wait, it doesn't matter. You have to go.
(desperate) How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me? Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.
(heartbroken but decisive) Yes, you are. Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman. We'll call him MARSHMALLOW.
(mantra-style) Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL! She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow up the wall, taking over the castle.
(scared) No. Please. One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches from her face. The thugs reposition to take another shot.
Stay away! Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and continue the attack.
No....What have I done? Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door.
Why did you bring me here?
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.
Don't you see...I can't. Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes.
You have to tell them to let me go. Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.
...Just take care of my sister.
What? No.
Anna! Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.
Oh, Anna...no...no, please no. Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.
Wha-? Anna? Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved.
...You sacrificed yourself for me?
(processing) Love...will thaw... (realizing) Love.... Of course. Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.
Love. Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air. Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws. The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves. The villagers come out to see the warmth returning. In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm summer day.
Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.
Are you ready? Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about. Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds some snow flurries for atmosphere. Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.
We are never closing them again. Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally made of ice) form on Anna's boots.
","I'm so sorry. Are you hurt? The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal.
Are you sure?
Oh, thank goodness. He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps her to her feet.
(bowing) Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
Princess...? My Lady. He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too, curling his hoof up and out of the boat. The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.
Oh boy.
I'd like to formally apologize for hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...and for every moment after.
Just you? Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's handsomeness.
Oh no. The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.
Glad I caught you.
(about her white streak) What's this?
I like it.
Twelve older brothers. Three of them pretended I was invisible... literally...for two years.
It's what brothers do.
I would never shut you out.
I love crazy. ""Love is an Open Door""
I was thinking the same thing, because like. . .
That's what I was gonna say! They slide down the back of the roof out of sight. We next find them strutting on a bridge ledge.
Can I say something crazy...? Will you marry me?
(bowing) Your Majesty. Elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey.
--your blessing--
Absolutely!
Your Majesty, if I may ease your--
Anna! Hans rushes to Anna's side. Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just scrambles into the mountains.
(shocked) Look.... The fjord. The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking the ships in place.
...Are you all right?
Did you know?
That's right she is... (realizing how that sounds) ...in the best way.
You slipped on ice.
What?
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.
I'm coming with you.
...On my honor. She throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse, coronation dress and all.
(before letting her go) Are you sure you can trust her? I don't want you getting hurt.
Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?
The castle is open. There's soup and hot glögg in the Great Hall. He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard.
Here. Pass these out. Just then the Duke approaches Hans.
(tall and confident) Princess Anna has given her orders and--
Do not question the Princess. She left me in charge, and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.
...Princess Anna is in trouble. (calling out) I need volunteers to go with me to find her! Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush up to offer their services.
We are here to find Princess Anna. Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the Queen. Do you understand? The Duke's thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow rises from the ground behind Hans. It's Marshmallow, Elsa's snow guard.
Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster they fear you are. Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened, moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans, overwhelmed, frightened. The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back. Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging directly above Elsa. The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN. Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast. All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the sound of it shattering as it rings out.
I couldn't just let them kill you.
Anna has not returned.... Elsa looks to the storm with worry.
If you would just stop the winter, bring back summer...please. Elsa meets his eyes, desperate.
I will do what I can. He opens the door and leaves. Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up.
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.
If anything happens to her--
Anna.
You're so cold.
What?
What happened out there?
You said she'd never hurt you.
Anna. Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.
(understanding) A true love's kiss. He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile. He leans in slowly...gently...
Oh, Anna. If only there was someone out there who loved you.
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere--
(putting out the candles) As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you-
You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that. Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table and goes to the fireplace.
I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa. Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire. Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak.
But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her.
(chuckles) All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer. Hans approaches Anna.
No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction. She wrenches her face out of his hands.
Oh, I already have. Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.
Princess Anna is...dead.
She was killed by Queen Elsa.
(really putting it on) At least we got to say our marriage vows...before she died in my arms. He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.
With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death.
Elsa. You can't run from this! Elsa backs away from him.
Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said you froze her heart.
I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white... Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done.
Your sister is dead... because of you. Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that, the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air, hangs suspended, trapped in grief. Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out to see... Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the fjords to...
(confused) Anna? But she froze your heart.
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa! He falls overboard. Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder, Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.
","How `bout yellow--no, not yellow. Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go. He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him. How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna.
Am I right?
(cheery, to Kristoff) Hi!
Please don't drop me.
Wait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
Oooh! Thank you!
Now I'm perfect. She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.
Woo! Head rush!
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! I've always wanted a nose. (going cross-eyed to look at his tiny nose) So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn. Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.
What? Hey! Whoa. (seeing his now big nose) Oh, I love it even more! Hah.... All right, let's start this thing over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs. Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.
...And you are?
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?
Oh. They're--oh, okay.... (accepting it) Makes things easier for me. Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose.
Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose. (gushes) I like you, too!
Yeah. Why? Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.
Yeah. Why?
Yeah. Why?
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here. (to Anna) Yeah, why?
(shocked) Summer? (sinking into wistfulness) Oh, I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot.
Nope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.
So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's go bring back summer! Olaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain.
(oblivious) Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever. Olaf backs right into an icicle. It runs through his torso.
Oh, look at that. I've been impaled. He laughs it off.
Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.
...Knock.... (she doesn't) Just knock.... (she doesn't. To Kristoff) Why isn't she knocking...? Do you think she knows how to knock? Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors slide open.
Bye, Sven. Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him.
Me?
Okay. As Anna walks inside. Olaf starts counting.
One...two... Kristoff joins in.
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
(bashful) You built me. You remember that?
Um...I think so? Anna kneels down beside Olaf.
(to Marshmallow) You are a lot stronger than I think you realize. Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps.
Watch out for my butt! Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the snowbank. Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle. Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.
...I'll distract him. You guys go. Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.
No, no, not you guys.
(muffled) This just got a whole lot harder. Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard right behind them. They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.
Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.
There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there! Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him.
(happily) Hey. We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things. Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor.
This is not making much of a difference! Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.
Hang in there, guys! Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.
(shaking the boots) I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs! Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up. He spits out snow.
(to Kristoff) Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt. Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body.
Oh, that feels better. Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose.
Hey, Sven!
He found us. (to Sven, funny voice) Who's my cute little reindeer?
I don't have a skull.... Or bones.
You hesitated.
Okay! Where are we going?
Love experts?!
I like to consider myself a love expert.
Look, Sven. The sky's awake. Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers.
(realizing) He's crazy. (covertly, to Anna) I'll distract them while you run. (Loud and slow to a rock) Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you! (quietly to Anna) Anna, because I love you, I insist you run. (to the rock) I understand you're love experts! (to Anna) Why aren't you running? Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away.
(excitedly) Kristoff's home. He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.
Wait? Kristoff? Anna watches, shocked and confused. The trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him down with a boulder's strength.
I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!
I'll meet you guys at the castle!
I will! He disappears into the village streets.
Anna. Oh no. He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood, including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues, before striking a match and relighting the fire.
Whoa! So this is heat.... (considering) I love it. He reaches a twig finger toward the flames. It catches on fire.
Ooh! But don't touch it! He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to the fire.
So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?
(confused innocence) Huh. But we ran all the way here?
I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you. He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against hers and thinks.
...Do you happen to have any ideas?
(confident) That's okay, I do.... Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder.
Love is...putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you? His face starts to melt.
(sweet and reassuring) Some people are worth melting for. But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow back in place.
Just maybe not right this second. Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.
Don't worry, I've got it! Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut but struggles with the second panel.
(determined) We're going to get through-- (distracted) Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something. He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope and sees... Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain.
It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way.
Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind. Anna tries to get to her feet.
No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.
(clueless) Why...? (realizing) Oh, oh, oh, I know why. He hops around in an excited display of hope.
There's your act of true love, right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! Come on! The walls crack under the ice pressure.
Look out! They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.
We're trapped. Anna looks around desperately for a way out.
Slide, Anna. It's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have? They slide down the iced-covered building. Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant snowball.
We made it! He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.
Keep going, Anna! Anna struggles on.
(confused, sad) Anna? Elsa hugs Anna and cries. Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his side. Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads. All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence. But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw. Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up. Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa.
An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.
(melting, good-naturedly) Hands down, this is the best day of my life...and quite possibly the last.
Hey, my own personal flurry. Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and stops him.
That's it. Glide and pivot and glide and pivot. We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been repaired with a ice. All is right in Arendelle.
