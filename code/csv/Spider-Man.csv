txt,"(rising) We begin again... let's kick in that new transducer. See if we can double the power output.
Okey... dokey! The POWER DIAL hits ten.
The anti-force experiment has now reached the limit of electronic overload safety. Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect the overload safety device... FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms) suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin working, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged master at manipulating these WALDOS. He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT marked, ""1,000,000""), illuminating it and filling our ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE. The knock on the door grows louder. WEINER comes up behind OCK.
(ignoring) World class scientific mind and they stick me in the basement with this third rate cyclotron... INSERT: The DIAL marked ""RELATIVE GRAVITY"" reads ""1,000,000"" but suddenly it snaps to ""0.999999!""
Okey! Dokey! The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it appears to lift ever so slightly.
Gentlemen, come, you must see this.
The imbeciles can wait... I have better things to do than teach introductory Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are kindless adolescence.
Thorkel you are the dummiest administrator our university has ever had. (Thorkel turns to go) Don't go Thorkel!! Come! Look! He starts to play his machines handles and buttons.
I am going for 20 percent power!
The universe is made up of forces... and counter-forces. Science is the study of the forces! FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely. He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on the last of the FIRE.
(continues without a hitch) But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have devoted my life to the study of the counter-forces! Good job, Peter.
Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel.
Well! This week my dear students I have made a stunning breakthrough...
I have no time for forms, or administrators who persist in interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel. THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR.
I now believe its possible that these counter forces can be... collected... the way the magnifying glass collects the sunlight... and focused into a hard beam I call... Weiner! WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word that OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says ""Anti- Force.""
I call it, the Anti-Force! OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with a SILVER BALL inside it.
(continues as he works) This anti-force, once harnessed, is capable of undoing any natural force at which it is aimed... for instance... (looks up maniacally) Gravity! LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word ""gravity."" Then she turns to PETER.
We patch in the cyclotron... The lights flicker and go dim.
Pay no attention to the lights... I of course steal its energy, and it looses power. We patch in the cyclotron... and we gradually apply power. The power that I am stealing... As the WHINE builds in the LAB... OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it. The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron's experimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins. It crackles round the SILVER BALL.
And so we stand, four square against the fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe... gravity... which is holding down this goddamn ball. Rise! The LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS and CATCALLS.
Mr. Parker! Have you some... interesting observation you'd like to share with the class?
Then shut up! And pay some attention to the experiment. OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL begins to rise. OCK'S face is ecstatic.
Rise! Rise!!! The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of the box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a
Now that's what I call an experiment! The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the COMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION BEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front. TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where their circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK depiction of ""space"".
You are looking at a representation of two universes. Our Blue one. Our real universe... something we can touch and feel and see and draw calculations about. This is us. The Yellow universe... this is something else. Some other dimension... something... on the other side! OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with each other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are
If it were possible to generate enough power behind it, the anti-force could wipe out not just gravity... but all our universal forces at the same time. In effect... it would blast a hole between this universe and the next. Each... (indicates green spheres) would flow into each other. No blue universe. No yellow. End, finished, over.
My girl, it is! It is. It would mean wiping out everything that's known... and letting in everything that's unknown.
Don't worry yourself, true inter- dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical, but one day... Maybe very near... maybe in the 21st century...
(back to Peter) We have a lot of interests in common, Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what I mean...
(turns with a smile) Now you take the Planetary Conjunction. This Saturday night we will witness Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the Sun... all in a row. Never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect. The total gravitational force must be quite exceptional. Isn't that the subject of your paper...?
I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think I could find the time to go over it with you. Make sure it all... checks out.
(to himself) The scoundrel... (turns angry) I want to see that data, Peter!
Well, I'm certain something can be worked out. Run along, young man. PETER begins to leave.
Just a minute... how about if I show you my discoveries... something I never showed to any other student... as a matter of fact to anybody at all.
Very well shall we say if you come here tonight...
Make it eight sharp... I'll be waiting for you... Right here... Peter looks worried then leaves. OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling.
The same academic world that's so keen to embrace that boy's undergraduate work, ridicules my anti-force theory as quackery. I ask you, Weiner... what is our society coming to? Ha!
Weiner! Go get me that boy's data!
(Weiner hissing) Just get it. We'll negotiate your fee when you have the data, alright Weiner?
Call an electrician.
What... what is he doing. He points toward the worker who's working on the lock on the main door.
(to Thorkel) You're denying me access to my cyclotron?!
(contemplating) Okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow. I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow... Ha... Tomorrow you can have this room...
I'll show them... closing the cyclotron on me... Weiner!
Where is he? It's ten past eight o'clock...
You are late. (to Weiner) Weiner, go outside and get us something to eat. And don't steal it! Just buy it. I'll reimburse you.
Piss off, Weiner! WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around. He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open WINDOW... and into the chamber.
Okey, dokey, Parker... how would you like to take Weiner's place... I mean, be my assistant?
Rosomorf... that imbecile. Don't you understand, kid, that I am about to uncover the greatest discovery since Einstein came up with his theory of relativity... The ""Anti-Force.""
Noble Shmoble, I am going for a much bigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me show you, kid, what I got here. OCK begins the experiment. We move in past the shattered WINDOW. We see the SPIDER crawling on the chamber's GEAR.
Present maximum anti-force power to date is 38 percent of theoretical limit. I have patched in the variable particle-wave accelerator... (shrugs) I will now try to reach 50% power... (big breath) And if your paper has any value... I can use it to get the power I'm missing to create the anti-force, to break through and beat any other form of power in our or any other universe, capish!
(screaming) 50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent... that's all I'm missing! Parker, we can be rich together!
(really angry now) You'll be sorry, Parker. PETER leaves. Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word, ""OVERLOAD!"" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward! The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB.
You! Get out of there, you creeping... He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand.
(anguish) Noooooooooooo! The gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as OCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which erupts like the 4th of JULY. OCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like snakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES! OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with
(ecstasy above the din) It's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey! We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck. The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions, valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where they twitch and writhe with a life of their own. Then, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the CYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO- STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction.
The cyclotron is damaged...
But my work!
Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters anymore. To enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own...
Destroy life. Life is... insignificant. Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What would you say?
(gets more and more excited) Thorkel, if I told you that for one moment in time I broke all the laws! For one brief glorious moment, I broke through to the other side. I saw... I felt... I became creation.
Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so clearly now. Universal destruction, yes. All I need is the power... then I can destroy this illusion you call life. It is my destiny to lead us to the light!
And you are a fool. I will end the universe as you know it. And in that final moment... I'll laugh my ass off while you're kissing yours goodbye!
Okey, dokey.
What a wreck. What a useless, wasted wreck. Okey, dokey. We rebuild you, my damaged darling. Bigger, better, hotter! A world class, super cyclotron! He hears a NOISE behind him and reacts. And here comes WEINER. Bedraggled, shuffling through the CONTROL ROOM door. He eyeballs the incredible wreckage.
Where have you been, you imbecile?
Wrestling...
Well, did you get it?
Lost him? You--
So how was the wrestling?
Spider-Man, huh? Well, maybe I'll just go and wrestle myself one of these days... with all my new arms... I'm sure I can beat Crusher or any other monster. Suddenly OCK throws out his WALDOS from under his long white coat, grabs WEINER and, lifts him up in the air, smiles cynically and with cruelty!
Will I beat him, this Crusher, will I beat him or not?
The Parker data... get me the Parker data, you hear?!!!
Wrap it up...
(a long beat) Cash! I'll be back soon.
Cash!
(turning from work) What do you think you're doing?
You're not going to any ball, clown. You're going to get me Peter Parker's data...
I don't care if you come back dead. Just get it!
Just get it, Weiner. I'm running out of time. If you fail me again, you won't have to concern yourself with money anymore... DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?! WEINER croaks his assent.
(smiling) Okey, dokey. OCK goes about checking out the CYCLOTRON. It looks good.
(reading dials and numbers) Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative variable differential... good enough. He shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down.
Okey, dokey... now all I need is Parker's data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it... I can't trust anybody. (throws his Waldo in the air) Only you, my babies... only you can I trust... Okay... If I have to do everything myself... I'm going to do it. (to his equipment) I'll be back... my babies... my new babies! OCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room.
Waldos... Did you hear about Spider-Man? (moving Waldos like spider's legs) That's me... the real Spider-Man... now tell me, where is that jerky friend of yours... Parker?
(running his Waldo in her hair) You wouldn't lie to your Professor now, would you?
We'll wait. OCK grabs LIZ'S HAIR with his WALDOS.
My Waldos, you mean.
Sit. She does. He does, too, and folds his WALDOS across his chest.
(chatty) He's a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe, but nice, wouldn't you say?
You know, you're a fascinating young lady...
You're so refreshing. You're so...
(gone to far) Oh, I wouldn't say shocking...
Peter Parker has something I want... And I'm going to have something he wants. She dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO
(holding Liz) Who the hell are you?
That's a lot of crap, clown... I am Spider-Man, not you. (points to Liz) Ask you girlfriend. (to Liz) Tell him!
Let her go? What an excellent idea. If you do not deliver your friend, Mr. Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll let her go.
(screams) Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man... Prepare to meet your death, bug. SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK.
I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking about exterminating you!
Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown. OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on. But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER- ADVERSARIES engage in battle. With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY, they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the
Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one will be able to stop me.
My destiny! OCK throws his biggest punch yet. SIRENS can now be heard in the street. SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning circles.
That's Professor Octopus to you Spider Jerk!
We are new inserting Peter Parker's data on tonight's Planetary Conjunction. INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays Peter Parker's name and ID number and the title, ""The Planetary Conjunction and it's effect on Earth Gravity.""
Yes, yes! Go on! Go on! INSERT: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then a GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN, JUPITER, the SUN and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER rises.
Enormous. It's enormous. (to recorder) The Parker calculations add 4% gravitational force at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. (hits some keys) Adding this to present maximum power potential, I get... He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC ""HOLE"" opening up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is swallowing everything!
I knew it. I knew it! Universal destruction! It's doable! I am putting a countdown clock on the Planetary Conjunction now! A LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY reads, ""13:00:03."" The last seconds count down to, ""12:59:59!""
(playing the computer) Okey, dokey. Now let's see if I have enough power to drive this beast. He starts hitting KEYS on his COMPUTER.
Fusion cells...? All up. Internal temperature... okay. Risk? (a long beat) Acceptable. (another beat) Let's fly. He starts flicking on SWITCHES and DIALS. The WHINE whirs up. He throws the RED POWER THROTTLE. The POWER DIAL goes to 90!
You!!! A WALDO smashes through the WINDSHIELD but misses SPIDEY. OCK leaps from the CAR.
(on the run) You're a doomed bug, Wall Crawler. I've no time to waste on you now.
Alright Spider-Bug... here I've come for you... OCK leaves the COP and attacks SPIDER-MAN, shooting his iron fist at him. OCK runs to the end of the alley. SPIDEY staggers to his feet and resumes the chase. OCK breaks into a red Corvette convertible, starting it with a WALDO. SPIDER-MAN comes out in time to see the Vette drive away. A CHINESE LAUNDRY TRUCK is passing. SPIDEY THWIPS it and is whipped away. He crawls over to the WINDOW.
Okey, dokey...
Insect! I am going to squash you to death... Once I lay my Waldos on your skinny bones... OCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the door with his SL 270.
Goodbye, Spider-Man!
So you've avoided the nuclear pool, have you, Spider-Man?
Pity...!
Okay... face to face... Catch this! OCK, way up at the opening above, raises a huge DRUM above his head. The DRUM leaks toxic waste in ORANGE TENDRILS. He is about to drop it down on SPIDER-MAN...
(puts down the drum) I know you... and you, young lady. Both of you are in my physic class, aren't you...? Come... you can help me. I need to get some of these drums to my laboratory... help me... and I'll give you special grades. What'd you say? Suddenly he catches FLASH with a WALDO and starts to choke him. LIZ screams and tries to help FLASH.
But, they won't help me. Everybody is trying to destroy my experiment. And so are you, Rosomorf. Another WALDO grabs ROZ by his arm.
You will? You too? Both FLASH and LIZ shake their heads okey dokey. OCK gestures to FLASH and LIZ.
Help me with these drums, I need to get them to my laboratory immediately.
Drive, Flash, before I flush your girl right down the toilet!
Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones... for the last time. OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back seat of the CAR.
(looking back, madly) Aha! You never included the Conjunction in your calculations, did you?! Rosomorf!
A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my destiny!!!
Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has started. My Anti-Force is on! History is being made... Spider-Man, Rosomorf cheer up friends... we're on our way to the unknown cosmos... we three are about to visit heaven... real Gods heaven.
Other worlds, Roz, other times, other dimensions, who knows? Who cares?
Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new truth! The new way!
No, you don't listen to that clown, he can't save you, or the world for that matter. A WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE
Once and for all, Spider-Man... once and for all we'll end the legend of your powers. OCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO. OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that's been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY. We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes flying in with the FIRE AXE. ROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury!
(ultimate betrayal) You!! You were my teacher!!! ROZ doesn't even look back. He and SPIDEY are at the edge of the HOLE and he's shaking SPIDEY furiously. OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY. Like a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the floor again and again.
You were my teacher! And you want to destroy my experiment. You are a scientist for heaven sake... don't you want to know what's up there?
Forget that old fool, insect. My Spider-Man... Come join me on my fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven.
Spider-Man. You're end is coming. Life in its present form is ending... new dimensions, new horizons... The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a rushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room towards the POINT of LIGHT.
(spaced out) You cut my power... there's too little power... It's so tiny... so tiny... there's only space... for me. But I've done it, Spider-Man. I have broken through... I've broken through!
Okey... dokey... Now that's what I call an experiment!!! As he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it. He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the room with BLINDING LIGHT. SPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light diminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet above the city!
","(ardent but uncomfortable) Hiya Liz... how're you doing...?
What is it? what...
(laughs, embarrassed) Yeah... well... all I got's the data but they've agreed to publish it when it's finished. You know... it's my calculation on the Planetary Conjunction.
Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with... (indicates Liz standing there)
(disappointed) Come on, Harry... we'll be late for Octavius. HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.
Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But, a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.
(embarrassed) It's nothing.
(regaining) I mean plain nothing.
Liz...!
No... look. The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE begin to build...
Liz! Come on...!
I'm coming! He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES. His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out.
Thanks for your help Flash.
Our hero has a real way with words.
(taking place at lab table) Thanks, Professor. THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S behavior.
It's alright. OCK is ""playing"" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the Opera at the organ.
Shut up Harry... this is very interesting.
No sir...
(whispers) He's not my type.
Check.
You don't get nicknamed Flash because you're a rocket scientist, Liz.
Yeah, of embarrassment. KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!
(embarrassed) Hi...
(frustrated) I can't... I gotta go over to the Daily Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos.
Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting you, Kim.
About my data I bet.
He knows about my work on the Planetary Conjunction, doesn't he?
Hello, Professor Octavius. (no response) I really admired your experiment.
(flattered) That would be... great.
Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect.
Well... I'm sort of working with Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. He thinks that my theory is... well, I don't know...
But Professor Octavius... if I knew you were interested... sorry, I've already given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our Physics Department... and I couldn't... OCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly.
Well I am really flattered, I mean I'd love to... but I...
But Professor I don't now if I should...
Yes, sir. JAMESON is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top. He too is forties. His chewed up CIGAR is forties. This guy is a hard case.
Yes, sir. JAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with a MOHAWK. PETER smiles in anticipation.
Yes, sir!
I know, I know. You want man bites dog...
(reading) Rent! Rent, more bills, rent... electricity, bills...
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
I am old enough to... to make my own--
I'll introduce you.
I take pictures, remember?
It's Friday night...
No.
No, I'm fine, Uncle Ben.
No, not so much anymore.
Little league.
Liz? She's great... But she has a boyfriend.
Aunt May... she has a steady boyfriend.
(lying to them) No, I'm alright. My scholarship covers almost everything, and I sell some photos here and there. Today my physics professor asked for some of my work... he wants to study my data. They might publish my work in the science magazine... that'll bring me some money...
(embarrassed laughs) Yeah, in fact I have to leave a little early tonight, to meet Professor Octavius... He offered me to be his assistant...
I... I can't, Aunt May. Professor Octavius wants to discuss my new findings.
Good evening.
No thank you, I just had dinner at my aunt's...
Well, Professor, that would be a great honor, but I'm already working with...
Wow! The theory of the Anti-force! You should go for the Noble Prize Professor...
Sorry, Professor, I can't do it. I gave my word to Professor Rosomorf. OCK is angry... Ock now sees the SPIDER. He shoots out a WALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast. The WALDO slams against the wall of the chamber. He starts to push every button or switch in sight. A deafening whining starts. An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the ""Relative Gravity"" DIAL. It is at ""4.999999KG"" but suddenly the numbers start to tumble rapidly. INSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT. INSERT: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER!
Sorry... I'd better go now.
How about nuclear contaminations?
(concerned) I don't know... Maybe Professor Octavius. He usually works late...
Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here? What's going on?
But sir, they wouldn't tell us. You heard Thorkel... he said...
Yes, but...
Sure, but I can't--
Yes sir!
You just said a hundred.
(calling back) Seeya guys. He dashes off. FLASH shakes his head in dismay at this guy.
Ow!!! PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door. Sweat starts to bead on PETER'S face. He shakes his head to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches against a WEIRD SINK. PETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not just moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that!
I feel a little funny...
(ultra wooz) Right. Police lines.
I... got pictures of the Professor... in there... it's so strange in there... so bizarre...
(mutters to himself) This is weird. My God, I feel so weird... He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of ""jumping jacks"" and on the third jump he soars into the air!
(exhilarated) Very weird. The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air. With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL where he lands sideways and sticks.
(sideways) Very, very weird. He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof. He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.
Well, what the hell!!
(reading card) Max Reiss, models, strip dancers, escort girls, blue movies...
Max Reiss, Talent management.
Yeah... well... why you approach me? I'm not...
Well...
(not a clue) Well... I don't know.
Ten.
(laughing) What are you talking about?
MTV...? Me? Really?
Hey!
(calling after) How do you know I'll show up? As the TAXI roars off...
Hello? Aunt May?
Well, no, I mean yeah I'm fine, but listen... Aunti, the craziest thing happened to me tonight.
No, no, look, there was this radioactive experiment... I was poisoned!
I was bitten by a bug.
No... No... A spider...
Aunt May, listen to me. I got bitten on the hand... by a poisonous spider.
No. I was in the bathroom and...
Yes, Aunt May.
Yes, Aunt May.
And I love you too, Aunt May. (hangs up) And by the way, I got a mess of super powers today. Exit booth. He BANGS the PHONE BOOTH. Goes out and-- jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof.
(looking up at the sign) MTV Wrestling?!
Look, Mr. Reiss... I'm not real interested in watching a wrestling match.
Me? You must be kidding. REISS hustles PETER inside.
Look, really, I don't know...
What is this?
(comes out) How does it look? I feel like it's Halloween.
Why?
Max! Am I really gonna get a thousand...
I'm Peter Parker.
(indicating truck) You know who that is?
He does...
Ock is not here!
Doesn't he look amazing in that one? Look, he's flying in the air!
Metal arms?
Ock...?!
Yes sir... (stops, and turns back)
The Journal said he was a mega-smash on
It's... embarrassing.
Yeah... ROZ, dressed as a COWBOY, ambles over.
(eyeing Spidey) Yes sir... oh... I'm going to be a little late with my paper on the Planetary Conjunction, sir...
Not the real one, I'm sure...
I bet I know who it is. As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying to read the BUGLE'S sports section by party light. KIM waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face.
Hiya, Liz... LIZ moves to Flash, who's dressed in the SPIDER-MAN costume.
It's a very clever outfit you've got there, Flash.
His pretty blue eyes give him away...
Well, yeah... sort of...
One day you'll know...
Uncle Ben!
Oh my God... Uncle Ben... PETER tries to revive BEN, while WEINER runs out.
I am... how is he... A grim-faced DOCTOR walks slowly across the room to them... MAY stands up slowly.
No, I... I think I wanna go out for some fresh air.
(panicked) Oh my God... oh, it's you, Liz... I didn't expect you... uh... give me a minute. He hides his SPIDER-MAN COSTUME.
(opening the door) Hi, Liz. Come on in.
(looking around) Cleaning up. Come on. I'll get your computer. Where's Flash parked? He picks up the COMPUTER and turns to her, but she's already looking around the apartment.
(holding it) Oh. Well... how are you going to get it home? LIZ walks into the room.
(embarrassed) I, uh, I'll go down to the corner... see it I can hail that taxi. PETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he so...?
Wait here...
Liz?
(whispers angrily) Octavius!!!
(hurrying by) Kim! Have you seen Harry?
Yeah... have you seen him today?
(keeps walking) Hi... have you seen Harry?
(laughs) Yeah, that was some ride home... must have been pretty exciting.
Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not tonight... see you later.
What about last night?
Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to find Harry... I'll see you later.
Hey! Can I get a lift downtown?
(pulling Harry aside) I gotta remember to have that fixed. (opens the door) There you are, I've been looking for you all over town.
Where were you?
Listen, Harry something terrible happened.
My Planetary Conjunction papers... they were stolen...
Ock...
We have to find out, sit down. (indicates computer) I want to access Dr. Octavius' main program. I want to know about his experiments with the cyclotron. Can you do it?
Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the Octavius file...
Yeah?
(looking over Harry's shoulder) Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time.
What is it?
Countdown to what?
The Planetary Conjunction?
Or Doc Ock's end of the world experiment... Or both!
You want to wait around till midnight to find out?
Let's see what else we've got. Another set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS.
It might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force.
The closest you could come is the New York City Subway System. Again, the lights flicker and then dim and they return.
Harry?!
Come on. I've found a way down.
Right there! We are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG.
Come on, help me with this.
Okay, stand still. He ties some ROPE around her waist.
How do I know?
Come on... They move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL PARK is still a couple thousand feet down.
Your prayers. They SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They reach out for each other but their hands don't quite reach. Slowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks between them.
Somehow, I don't think we've seen the last of him.
What...? What is it? Why do you look like that?
(even his eyes blush) You are...
Spider-Man? You're in love with Spider-Man?
We might... you never know. He kisses her.
Nah. They land in the center of the park under the parachute. They stay there and kiss... completely covered by the flag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.
","(falling in step) Hiya Peter... LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and intelligent.
(teasing softly) How'm I doing what?
(growing impatient) Peter? A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom.
(elbowing him affectionately) Flash...! They kiss and walk away.
(softly) What is it, Peter?
Well, do you mean nothing... or do you mean something but you won't tell me what it is?
Well, I guess that's about as nothing as you can get... plain nothing. A beat.
Ahh, it is something.
I can't. Help me!
Peter! Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him.
(out at the street) Help! Help me! Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course) down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her. PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain. LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE
Oh, why don't you grow up. PETER is stung, insulted, turns away. ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel.
(whispers) I'm sorry...
(with a student's ear) That sounds like a scenario for the end of the world.
(whispers to Peter) Look, it's just... I don't know... when you and Flash go after each other like that...
He doesn't have to be.
And besides, he's not all bad. PETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his finger with great joy and concentration.
Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a nickname like Flash.
Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is my new roommate... Kim Nickson. KIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the boys. They go bug-eyed!
We're going to the Student Reunion Meeting. You coming? Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in the ribs. Yeah, yeah!
It's not what you said, it's how you say it, ShooShoo! Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his bag down.
(more interested in other things) Could anyone be in there, Peter?
Where is he going?
Will you two shush. I'm trying to work.
(walking ahead) Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last night... boy does Flash think he's hot.
Hey, we better rush... visiting hours will be over soon.
My God, what happened?
Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man costume?
(to Peter) How did you recognize him?
(whispers to Flash) I wanna dance... Hey, Spider-Man... Shall we Flash dance?
I'm not... She reaches for HARRY'S hand.
Hey, Peter! These are your pictures!
It says here ""Photos by Peter Parker."" PETER reacts, then looks over FLASH'S other shoulder. INSERT: There are three PHOTOS of SPIDER-MAN in the paper. PETER BLUSHES, smiling.
(to Flash) Come on... Flash... FLASH takes LIZ from PETER (SPIDER-MAN). LIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers. The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number in film history. He's all over the floor and on the walls and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops in a pose. BIG CHEERS. LIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN'S face.
(whispers breathless) Who are you...?
(a long beat) You sound very familiar.
What were you doing in here?
Flash didn't come.
Taxi... I guess. She discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up around the apartment.
You must spend a lot of time with this Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don't you think you ought to unplug that! PETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall. Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down.
(crossing to it, wondering) Peter...? She is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered doorway, WALDOS writhing.
Doctor Octavius...! You're... You're... (finds the words) You're so weird!... with those... what do you call those...
(protecting) Peter?... oh... he's not here. He's gone. I don't think he'll be back for awhile.
Of course not. Why would I lie about a thing like that? Really. He's... out.
What are you doing... let me go! Please... take those things out of my hair!
Whatever you call them... please... OCK shoots out TWO WALDOS. Simultaneously each grabs a CHAIR from different parts of the room and brings them to the TABLE.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe. He's very inexperienced. ONE of OCK'S WALDOS rests on the TABLE curled around the COMPUTER. LIZ lets her hand rest on it. OCK warms immediately.
Thank you...
Shocking...?
I would! She sticks his WALDO in the ELECTRIC WALL SOCKET behind the COMPUTER! The CURRENT sizzles through him and he leaps up, WALDOS akimbo, like the ""cartoon cat."" LIZ runs out the door. OCK extricates himself from the current and gives chase.
Peter...! She looks both ways for PETER, doesn't see him, and takes off! OCK bursts from the doorway and runs off after LIZ.
(seeing Spidey) Spider-Man...
Put me down, you mechanical mutant! LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She twists. She flails around, making things a little worse. The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP! PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets! SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short.
(falling away) You jerk! He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound.
(straightening herself) Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get the taxi myself...
Great... SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by another barrage of blows from above.
What do you think you're doing?
Thanks but nooooooooooo!
Wait a minute. Where are you taking me? SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl.
(Times Square) Where are we?
(the Empire State Building) If you're trying to impress me Spidey, I want you to know I'm not easy. Okay, I'm impressed... now put me down, Spidey... put me down.
(Tavern on the Green) Wow... look, this is our dormitory. I can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute... there's Flash, if I'm not mistaken.
You know my name?
Okay, put me down and we can talk, alright?
All I know is you're the Amazing Spider-Man... or better you're Spidey the good guy on the block... you're a weirdo in a clown spider suit.
Which one?
Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend...
There's someone I like, but he's too shy to notice. (Flash appears)
(to Spider-Man) You know everybody... Flash we have to call Peter! FLASH rushes right past LIZ to the WINDOW. There's a NEWSPAPER in his hand.
(accusatory) How'd you know this was Flash's place?
Peter told you all about Flash?
(distracted) Peter told your Hero all about me...
(catching up) Peter...!
No. What a night, huh?
It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets to Les Miserables... wanna go?
(thinking) Hey, Peter... how did you know about last night...?
My exciting ride with Spider-Man...
Peter! PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it.
(embarrassed) Thank you. He really wanted so badly to come see you. He called me up out of the blue.
Oh, you know Peter... he's all caught up in some kind of study he's doing. Things are really crazy at the university now. Things are crazy... everywhere. I guess Peter's just... well, you know... pulled into his shell.
Yeah... well. I don't think he wants me to find him... Well, I'd better be going. My friend Flash is picking me up.
No... not really... I think you can guess why... They smile knowingly at each other. LIZ goes toward the DOOR.
What?
Don't you recognize him... it's Ock!
Leave him alone!!! Another WALDO grabs her. ROZ now appears on the scene.
(still ministering) What do we do now?
Wait... I think I can release my right hand...
Harry! Get over here! HARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing ""WARNING, Security Breach!"" HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around. LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend
(mysteriously) I bet he is with Spider-Man... Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake.
Look at the moon... I have never seen it so big.
He's in there. I know Peter is in there. She breaks into a run.
Peter! Peter, where are you?!
Peter! The building lurches throwing her back across the HALL where she crashes through another door.
Peter! Peter!
Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere.
This building is flying. I'm in a goddamn flying building...
Oh my God... A third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER
(bracing against the storm) What is happening?
I can't... hold on! SPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB.
Don't do it, Dr. Octavius!
But what about Peter? We've got to find Peter!
Go where?
It's breaking apart!
We have to go back.
Forget it...
(shouting across) What am I supposed to do with this!
The door is stuck. SPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR open.
(at long last, love) I knew you were going to say that. They run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit.
Where's the way out?
Is this going to work?
I just adore confidence in a man.
What is it you say when you jump?
We have a lot to thank your friend Spider-Man for.
Peter...! Finders, keepers...
I think I'm in love.
With your friend...
I am... you think we'll see him again?
Oh. (bittersweet) This may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know?
","(whispers to himself) Wow...
Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really...
And one like this... (changing pose) And one looking real sincere. The WHITE EYES narrow to a slit. CLICK. Suddenly he spots WEINER climbing onto his roof. He hides. WEINER tiptoes into the roof apartment. SPIDER-MAN jumps in and grabs him.
What are you doing here?
Oh, yes... so why not use the front door? SPIDER-MAN throws him back onto the roof so that he almost slides over the edge. WEINER turns, facing SPIDER-MAN.
You do?
You like wrestling? SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER.
Of course I'll help you down. I am Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not?
And by the way, Peter Parker does not live here anymore... SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of the roof.
And tell the Professor he can't have Peter's data. Goodbye. SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors straight down into heavy bushes below.
(fearful) Hey! Can't you go any faster?
(fighting his fear) I don't know... I get this tingling in my brain, like some danger is lurking just ahead. I'm worried about Aunt May and Uncle Ben...
Well, they are kind of my parents. They raised me. I lost both of my parents in a car accident... please step on it!
But I'm telling you... I've got this--
Please... Faster... Please.
(panicked) Look, I'm really in a hurry. BANG! A BLOW OUT. The CABBIE fights the wheel to the side of the road. Then he turns to SPIDEY.
(a thought) Sporting goods...
(cold, hard) Say your prayers, Weiner! WEINER whips around and fires. SPIDEY leaps to avoid it and lands on a STACK of PAINT CANS.
(hanging on ceiling) Hey, creep! WEINER aims and fires, several times. He is emptying his RIFLE. SPIDEY leaps away and lands on the top of a CASK marked ""CAUTION-FLAMMABLE SOLVENT!""
(taunting) Try again. The CASK gives way and SPIDEY is plunged into the FLAMMABLE SOLVENT. WEINER smiles his stupid grin and takes aim. SPIDEY leaps out of the CASK and sticks to the roof BEAM. He's sopping wet. His hand slips down the BEAM as the SOLVENT works against his sticking power. He falls to the floor and scrambles behind some PAINT CANS. WEINER, crazed, fires wildly. One of the CANS EXPLODES. PAINT flows from it... burning! SPIDEY peeks out and sees a YELLOW RIVER OF FLAME creeping toward him. He sniffs his SOLVENT soaked outfit. He backs down a ""corridor"" of PAINT CANS. The YELLOW FIRE follows, now joined by a RIVER OF BLUE FIRE from another can. They're following the trail of SOLVENT he's dripping! He's trapped!
Well, look what we've caught in our web...
I know what's happening to you, Ock. I've been through a lot of changes myself lately. You have to listen to me.
Spider-Man.
I'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock. Just like that girl you're holding. Now let her go. OCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories up.
(whispers) Actually, I'm rather fond of living... especially now... (he looks at Liz) He lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above the street.
(a last appeal to reason) Octavius. Just stop and think.
Okay, if that's the way you want it... Let's see what those chrome knuckles can do, Doc... A WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw. It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and rolls over. He rubs his jaw.
Stop you from what...?
Over here, Octopus!
Give it up, Professor. You'll never catch me! OCK takes three steps and soars through the air.
So long, sucker.
I'm rescuing you. With that SPIDEY leaps way out and he and LIZ swoop away on a WEB-STRAND.
I better just take you back where you belong. He shoots out another WEB.
Hold on tight.
Open your eyes. They are standing on the ROOF of the CENTRAL TOWER of the EMPIRE UNIVERSITY BUILDING. LIZ opens her eyes. It's an extraordinary sight.
I like the way you say Spidey... Nobody calls me Spidey... now we go...
Liz?
Liz, listen to me. There's something I have to tell you.
Do you know who I am?
And that's all you know about me? (a beat, a sigh) Okay, lets get your boyfriend.
How many do you have? I meant Flash.
He's not? Then who is?
Flash!
Thanks.
She needed a lift.
Thanks, but I have some business to take care of.
Peter Parker told me all about it.
No... he told me all about you. See you later. (he jumps away)
Hello, everybody... He slides the WINDOW down and flips inside. He walks through the parting PASSENGERS to the BUILDING WALL. He feels it.
Okay, everyone, stand back and stay cool. He hurls himself at the fused GLASS portion and bounces back onto the floor. He rolls over, flexing his shoulder.
Somebody wanna give me a hand with this? First the WOMAN, and then all of them, take up positions on the BATTERING RAM.
On three. One... Two... Three! They ram the GLASS and it shatters.
Have a nice evening, Ma'am... and you too, Henry.
Okay, folks, just hang on... He scampers down the GRAB-HANDLES to the people below. FOUR PASSENGERS cling to SEATS and BARS.
Okay, one at a time. You first, Ma'am... A FAT WOMAN makes a ""who me?"" gesture. SPIDEY throws her over his shoulder. INSERT: THE COUPLING which holds the two CARS at right angles begins to bend open. SPIDER-MAN, the FAT WOMAN over his shoulder, goes hand over hand to the top and the WOMAN is dumped into the
Sure thing, just don't take the train. Come on... give me your hand.
Let's get you out of here first, Professor.
Where can I find him...?
Think Rosomorf, think where one can find Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270...?
Where...?
You're making a big mistake.
Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270 Plutonium... must get that crazy old loony... before he gets to the Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the toxic dumps...? He hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely.
Got to find Ock... got to find the toxic dumps. (grabs his head) Oh! Oh! Oh... yeah! He looks down at the traffic. We PAN across the many CARS until we come to a non-descript GREEN CAR.
What's up, Ock?
Hey, you big OCK, why don't you pick on someone your own size?!
Hey, driver. Could you follow that red Vette for me? The surprised CHINAMAN lets loose a stream of CHINESE expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures. SPIDER-MAN crawls to the top of the TRUCK and surveys the situation. He sees a sea of moving traffic. He THWIPS up a WEB and swings away. SPIDEY swings along from BUILDING to BUILDING. The RED VETTE is making headway. Suddenly, SPIDER-MAN spots a blue MG with its top up.
(swinging) Flash Thompson... I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
Sorry about that!
Flash, I need your help.
You any good with this thing?
Okay... catch that Vette!
New Jersey has the largest toxic waste dump in the world.
He's looking for Plutonium, my dear... The car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam.
Try to stay with me. I don't want to lose him! Speeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes it across. The VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN. He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It says, ""DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!""
Bingo.
Open that now, and you'll spoil Christmas. SPIDEY'S peering in from a HOLE in the ROOF.
Noooooooooooooo! He gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the POOL. Its weird light shines up at him. He looks up at the starry sky.
(to himself) Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it. He shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the wall, sizzles, and drops back down.
(to himself) Don't give up, Spidey. Don't give up. The WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO. Then it hisses, empty!
Empty... now what do I do?
Well, so far so good. But I can't hold on much longer.
Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport. Let's talk this over face to face... throw me a line... SPIDEY reaches out.
Professor Rosomorf, it's no good, double dealing... why did you help him...? ROSOMORF finds a rope and looks into the well.
Stop the car. I have an idea. They're in the middle of RIVERSIDE DRIVE but a PHONE BOOTH is coming up on the right. INSERT: ROZ'S foot stabs the BRAKE.
Do you have a dime?
Listen, Harry. You must get my paper before Ock uses it...
He can get to the power. Electrical power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL 270. And now, at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. When all the planets line up with the sun... maximum gravitational power. The Conjunction is Ock's final power source.
The only way we can interfere with Ock's plan is to find a computer center... fast.
Yeah, but who's gonna work 'em?
It's started. Step on it Professor, or we'll never make it. They look across the campus and a strange LIGHT is coming out of the SCIENCE CENTER.
Stop the car...! Come with me.
I'm afraid we're too late. SPIDER-MAN attacks OCK, trying to push him away from the THROTTLE. OCK pushes SPIDER-MAN away from him so strongly that SPIDER-MAN is knocked down. OCK nudges the POWER THROTTLE forward and the WHINE increases to an ear shattering pitch. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, ""00:06:48"". We are at 96% POWER!
Don't listen to him Professor Roz.
Roz!!! (turns to Ock) Murderer!!!
Let's have it, old boy! A bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way and that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold, from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET. Now the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL upside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes flying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life!
Liz!! OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE. SPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE.
Come on.
(pulling her ahead) He's around, don't worry... we'll find him.
I think we have to pull some of these cables. Try those over there. I'll work on these. We gotta slow this thing down somehow. We got helicopters coming. LIZ looks at some WIRING, apprehensive about even touching it.
Pull! She yanks out a CABLE. The building pitches. But when SPIDEY pulls one out, it rights itself.
The power! LIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at ""00:00:10"". LIZ leaps and tries to wrestle it away. It whips in her arms and she holds on tight. It bangs her against the wall and then the CONSOLE. She holds on. ""00:00:03"". The WALDO crashes LIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS. She lets go of it. It heads for the POWER THROTTLE! ""00:00:01!"" SPIDER-MAN can't break the grip of the WALDOS, but he can pull with super-human strength. He yanks OCK up through the STONE floor. OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL ROOM. ONE WALDO grabs on. The other one throws the RED
(similarly braced) I don't know!!! LIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles against it.
Hold tight, Liz, hold tight! OCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room. He moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT.
I can't control her. She's dropping too fast! Alright... let's go!
Peter will be okay, I promise you... Let's go before it's too late. (he grabs her)
Maybe there's another way... A HUGE CRACK opens above them.
Alright, keep moving, a step at a time! They scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side, half the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000 feet below.
We can't go back. He looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal wall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between themselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ.
Okay, have it your way. He swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze. LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN, furious.
(shouting back) Go ahead. It's easier than it looks! We've got to try the fire escape. LIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on the LEDGE. She does a comic ""phew"" and the LEDGE buckles beneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the door, but it's stuck.
","Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that? With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor.
(rising more slowly) Whoa, Doc... wait a minute... But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, ""eight, nine..."" the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is shattering.
Whoa, Doc... someone's at the door...
Yes, gentleman can I help you?
(looks) You better tell him yourself. THORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder, then the both call.
Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you.
I don't know.
(lies) I don't know.
They are all a bunch of brainless assholes, that's what I say...
Cost you fifty bucks.
Yes, Professor...
(with mouth full) That must be him. He opens the door.
(to Peter) Do you want anything Parker?
Professor... what happened to you? What did you do... Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he flies back and out through the door to the corridor.
Oh my God... what happened here... He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away.
I better get out of here.
There you are, doc... where have you been... whoa this place is messed up. OCK turns, WALDOS writhing. WEINER sees them and kind of ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once.
(smirks) Whoa, doc! You look a little messed up yourself.
I went to the wrestling...
I went after the kid. You still want that Parker guy's data, don't you?
No, I followed him... but I lost him in the crowd.
I'll find him, Maestro... I promise... soon... maybe by tomorrow.
Fantastic! There was this new wrestler... beat the mighty Crusher. You won't believe it... a nothing of a guy... calls himself this stupid name... the Amazing Spider-Man... would you believe it?
No... no, please... I mean yes, yes... you'll beat him easily... let me down... Please... I'll do anything for you...
I'm looking for Peter Parker.
Hey, I know you...
I saw you crushing the Crusher.
I love it! You are the best wrestler I have ever seen... please don't hurt me! SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately. SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna.
Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help me down.
Yes... yes, you are. SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his arms and whispers to him.
I'm going to the Masquerade. It's Halloween tonight Doc, aren't you coming to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go without an outfit. A WALDO whips around WEINER'S throat... AARRRGH!
I was almost killed on my last try... Look at all these bruises...
(croaking) Cost you a thousand bucks, if I get it. The WALDO coils tighten around WEINER'S throat.
All right... boss please let go...
Hmmm...
All I want it the kid's computer crap!
You ain't takin' me... Spider-Man... who ever you are... SPIDEY gathers himself tighter. He leaps. A second GUN BURST comes in behind him, Several PAINT CANS erupt in cascades of COLOR.
(at the window) Stay back! (gun burst) Whoa... stay back down there! SPIDEY is inches from being torched. He sees a PIPE. He reaches out and grabs it. He swings out above the flames. But the PIPE begins to bend! The PIPE bends down... down... and then breaks! SPIDEY hangs precariously as WATER cascades out of the PIPE and puts out the FIRE. SPIDEY drops down and rest his head in his hands to collect himself. Then looks up. The GUN is at his head.
Stand up, you. SPIDEY stands.
You're my ticket outa here. Gimme that stupid mask! SPIDER-MAN hesitates. Then he begins to raise the MASK, but stops and shakes his head no.
Then I'll take it myself. He reaches for the mask and SPIDER-MAN flips him across the room. WEINER lands in a CARGO net and becomes ensnared.
Don't hurt me, man. Please don't hurt me...
Get me out of this madhouse! He falls down, immediately encircled by the POLICE OFFICERS. SPIDER-MAN flies above their heads, crashing through the WINDOW and disappears into the dark of night.
