txt,"(to Big Bob) Watch this for me, big buns.
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
(grinning) I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Thanks, Chuck. I need the money. Can I still work the hours around my classes? Breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurant's small accounting computer. Sarah looks over his shoulder as he modifies the week's schedule.
Alright!
It's not brain surgery, Chuck. Breen hands her an apron ceremoniously.
I won't let the fat kid down.
Hi, I'm Sarah and I'll be you waitress. (pause) I'm so wholesome, I could puke.
Yes sir, just a second. She reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines in lock-step.
Who gets the Burly Burger?
Okay, who gets the Burly Beef?
(mopping fran- tically) Oh, sorry. That's not real leather, is it? As she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of Sarah's apron She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned and sags with defeat. NANCY, a plump, gum-chewing waitress, stops beside her to whisper.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
You must have a girlfriend.
Aha! Is she young? Mr. Miller lowers his menu and glares at her.
(smiling) What's it to ya? When she leaves, the old man is grinning, behind the menu, where no one can see him.
I'm on break, Chuck. Carla's got my station. As she approaches the locker room where the girls take their coffee breaks, the door bursts open and Nancy beckons to Sarah.
I'm Sarah. Ginger's roommate.
...yeah, really? Say some- thing in Italian. Before Marco can reply, Ginger pulls the front of his gym shorts out and peers down. She shakes her head.
(weakly) I don't believe you did that. Ginger is adjusting her ever-present WALKMAN-TYPE CASSETTE PLAYER at her hip. She slips on the earphones as they walk along. Sarah feigns outrage.
(continuing) I had him hooked. He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
I'll do the same for you sometime. Sarah laughs and claps her friend on the back. They turn in at a door marked WEIGHT ROOM.
Hi, Matt. Matt look backwards over the bench, and replies, upside-down.
(answering the phone) Hello?
Ginger! It's Matt. She resumes listening.
(crossly) Who is this? Silence. Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been talking to.
Sure, Bunky. As Ginger approaches, Sarah hands her the receiver and goes into the bedroom.
What do you think?
How about this?
You're a big help.
I hate the beige one.
(continuing) You think the beige?
(calling) Ginger, have you seen Pugsley? Ginger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine.
(still looking) I thought you did. She checks under the couch, then behind the drapes. She bends down.
(from beside cur- tains) Come here young man. Mind your mother. C.U. - PUGSLEY, as the GREEN IGUANA cocks its head, blinking vapidly. RESUME WIDE, Sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his perch on the windowsill. She gives the complacent reptile a kiss on its blunt snout.
(slumping) I'll live.
You still love me, don't you, Pugsley? She places Pugsley in a large terrarium with a 'BEWARE OF DOG' sign taped on the side.
(continuing) I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'. You and Matt have a good time.
(shouting) Leave it where it is!
(continuing, into phone) ...I think somebody's after me and I sure hope you play this soon 'cause I need you and Matt to come pick me up. The police keep transferring me around, but I'm going to try them again.
(continuing, B.G.) The number here is 468-9175. Call me, kiddo. I need you. It's Stoker's on Pico. Bye. Terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents of Sarah's small desk. SIREN'S WAIL, approaching. He picks up a small card. E.C.U. - CARD. It is Sarah's college I.D. card, complete with color photo of her.
(on phone, upset) ...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
(on phone) Yes, but I don't want to leave. I think this guy's following me.
(uncertainly) Lieutenant Vukovich? REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich. Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT. Blue eyes so pure and deep. The eyes of a saint, perhaps. The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost in one motion. The bore seems enormous. BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide. We hold a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare. MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi- tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap. HE FIRES. ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES, simultaneously. Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing out of the booth seat inches from her face. Her hair is singed by burning gunpowder. An involuntary cry is punched out of her by the double concussions. Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises from booth. OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires again, advancing on Sarah's booth. Terminator is blown backward over the center divider, crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the table opposite, and onto the floor. Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth. Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table- full of drunk patrons. He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one in the arm. The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering, gaping. Sarah stops screaming. Reese stand motionless, gun aimed. In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun is abnormally loud. ON TERMINATOR, very still. Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang- ing on a shoulder strap. He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire. Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing. A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood. An orgy of shattering glass. Total pandemonium. SEVERAL ANGLES as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence. Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes her wrists. ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI one-handed. Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion erupt with hits from the UZI. ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches him in the chest. He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning her. Reese fires, ducks, fires again. Tables crash over. A window is blown out. A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol behind the bar. It ignites with a WHOOSH. Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun. TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement amid the confusion. He drops a spent clip. Reaches for another with his bloody hand. MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts firing. At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into Terminator's belly.
(awed whisper) Oh my God...
(a whisper) Yes. Don't hurt me.
(hoarse whisper) This is a mistake. I haven't done anything.
I can't believe this is happen- ing. How could than man get up after you... Reese's tone is equal parts hatred and respect as he replies.
A machine? You mean, like a robot?
But...he was bleeding. At that moment a blinding light sears down on them from above. Reese looks over his left shoulder and sees a CHP cruiser coming alongside.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
And you're from the future too?
(patronizingly) Right... Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock and has the door half open before Reese can react. He catches her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car. Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength. His grip doesn't slacken. Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his other hand and shuts the door. His face shows no reaction. Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face. The light turns green and Reese drives on. Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.
(weakly, plead- ing) Just let me go.
(quietly) Can you stop it? Reese doesn't look at her.
Reese...why me? Why does it want me? They are lying very close, a forced intimacy. Reese's voice is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear. A cruiser passes so close they can hear its radio clearly.
Tell me. Just start at the beginning. Reese musters his thoughts. And starts.
I don't understand...
The what?
(shouting) Reese!
(voice flat, desperate) Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
(to herself) Of, God...Ginger...kiddo, I'm so sorry. Vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and it starts to spill.
(almost in- audible) I guess so. (to Silberman) You're a doctor?
Is Reese crazy?
(turning) So Reese is crazy.
But... Vukovich hands her something that looks like umpire's padding.
But what about him punching through the windshield?
I can't sleep.
Okay. She lays her head on a wadded up blanket as everyone leaves the office.
Freezing.
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
You're wet. Oh my god. In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening with blood.
(incredulous) Caught one? You mean you got shot? Reese shrugs.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Forget it? Are you crazy? Let me see it. Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.
(continuing) Jeez. You idiot. Take this off. She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Just talk. Tell me about my son. Is he tall? She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.
What's he like?
Well, at least I know what to name him. I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
(interrupting) Stop! I don't want to know. Hold still. So...it was John that ordered you here?
You volunteered?
You talk about things I haven't done yet in the past tense. It's making me crazy. I can't think. (pause) Are you sure you've got the right person? Reese appraises her coldly.
Come on, me? The mother of the future? Am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook. I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats. She pulls the bandage tight with a knot.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
(angry) Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
(brightening) You like it? It's my first. He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth- conserving embrace. Sarah gazes out the entrance, into the night.
(closing her eyes) Okay. Talk some more.
(murmuring) About where you're from. Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.
I was dreaming about dogs. Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the culvert.
Your world...it's pretty terrifying.
Put that away. I'll get one. She hold out her thumb to passing traffic. Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.
(continuing) This works...really.
(to Reese) He's a surfer.
No, he's from the future.
Thanks.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle. She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her inside.
...I know, Mom. This is the soonest I could...I know. Mom...Mom, I can't talk long. No, I'm okay. (pause) I was on TV? Really? (pause) Oh no, I hate that picture... why didn't you give them my graduation picture? (pause) I'm okay, really. Listen, I want you to pack some stuff and go up to the cabin for a few days. Just don't...no, don't ask any questions. Just do it. I gotta get going...gotta go. Bye, bye. Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY. On a whim she looks up something. She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing. Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out of the book.
Thanks a lot.
That's where we're going.
Look. I found it. Isn't that it? Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government. Right?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard. Eighty-six it. We'll blow up the place...burn it down. Something.
Reese. Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. We have to so it ourselves.
(upset, mocking his manner) Listen. Understand. I'm not a military objective, Reese. I'm a person... You don't own me. Reese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet.
Fuck you! Let go of me! She jerks her arm free. He reaches for her again but she outdistances him, running.
Let...go...bastard... She gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face. Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive crouch. Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his hand.
(continuing, scared, but angry) Oh, that's real smart. Go on, shoot me. That's brilliant. Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun. Sarah too is shaking with emotion. Tears roll down her cheeks and her voice cracks.
(continuing) Jesus Christ, Reese. Can't you see I'm scared? He straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides. He turns away.
(continuing) I can't spend my life waiting for that thing to catch up with me...always looking over my shoulder, wondering if I left some tiny clue behind... Reese doesn't respond. The gun slips from his fingers. His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees. The moment stretches. There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.
Reese? She crawls over to him.
(continuing, quietly) Kyle?
We can change it, Kyle. We have to try. She takes his shoulder in her hands.
(continuing) There's no fate but what we make for ourselves. Right? Come on. Let's go, kiddo. Whaddya say? He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a second, then get up.
Yes. And I don't want to know where you got it. She turns to the desk clerk, a female version of the pawn- shop lizard.
(to clerk) We need a room...with a kitchen.
I'm dying for a shower. You could use one too. And we'd better check that bandage.
...No, Mom, I can't tell you where I am. I was told not to say.
Okay, here's the number. Are you ready?
Let's see. Corn syrup. Ammonia. Moth balls... Mmm. What's for dinner?
What's that?
You must have had a fun child- hood.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done. You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I want it to be over for you.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now. Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us. Reese looks up and finally catches her gaze. He reaches out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to comfort her. But he turns her wrist to read her watch.
He'll find us, won't he?
Don't say that.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed.
(softly) Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
A girl. You know.
(softly) I'm sorry. Sarah studies him for a moment. She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars with her fingertips.
So much pain.
And so you feel nothing.
(with great sympathy) Oh, Kyle. Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.
Kyle... She leans forward and kisses him. His face is frozen. A mask. She continues, tenderly. He begins to respond. The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling embrace, clinging to her like life itself. Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed. She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with her lips. He unbuttons her blouse very slowly. Sarah guides his powerful hands over her.
I bet you're ticklish.
(continuing doggedly) You'll beg for mercy in a second. Reese seems unperturbed. Finally he begins to squirm.
You're not supposed to. Now Reese is becoming desperate. A grimace spreads across his face. It becomes a grin. Then he's laughing, trying to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing together. Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might have been, in another life. A moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking outside. Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes alert. Feral as ever.
Kyle...oh God... He has a bullet in the chest. Another has broken his arm. Sarah feels all hope recede.
Alriiight!
(rapidly) Come on, come on, come on ...run, you... The bike runs with a healthy roar.
Hold on real tight, okay? She guns the engine and roars off.
(shouting) Hold on, goddamnit! He rouses slightly, gripping her tighter. HIGH ANGLE - MOVING WITH BOTH VEHICLES as Sarah starts to ZIGZAG desperately across all four lanes. The truck stays with her, closing, its trailer WHIPLASHING VIOLENTLY.
We did it, Kyle. We got it. She hugs him.
(panting) What are you doing?
I'm not leaving you anywhere you jerk. Haven't you figured it out? Kyle, John is our son. Reese's eyes refocus.
(continuing) There isn't going to be anybody else...I don't want anybody else. Listen to me! She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout.
(continuing) Move! Reese! Let's go. Move you ass! She drags him to his feet and he staggers on. Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward. The Terminator scans the darkness. ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through the machines. The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically. Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous tangle of pipes and machinery. Kyle picks up a length of pipe to use as a weapon. As they climb out onto a cat- walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over an innocuous CONTROL PANEL. Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON. With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams down an inch from her hand. Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk. The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non- rhythmic sound. Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the door there locked.
Come on! They double back to escape the cul-de-sac. The Terminator steps in front of them, cutting them off.
(voice icy) You're...terminated...fucker! E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down. FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the
(continuing) Should I tell you about your father? That's a tough one. Will it change your decision to send him here...knowing? But if you don't send Kyle, you could never be. God, you can go crazy thinking about all this...I suppose I'll tell you...I owe him that. And maybe it'll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime's worth... CLICK. WHIR. Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking her reverie. A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture with a beat-up Polaroid camera. He holds it out to her, speaking rapid Spanish.
That's a pretty good hustle, kid. Four. Quatro. The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the snapshot develop. It is a good photograph of her, the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought- ful, slightly sad. We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029. She slips it into her short pocket.
What did he say?
(quietly) I know. CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the flat desert on a ribbon of highway. A brilliant flash crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the world.
","What day is it? The date...
(viciously) What year? A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind Reese's head. He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the amazed cop lying on the floor. Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police Special in his coat. Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the escalators.
Gimme a falafel with, uh, yogurt and Baco-bits. The counterman barely looks up as he passes the mess through the window.
Come with me if you want to live. She looks where he is pointing.
(calmly) Hold on.
Are you injured? Are you shot? No response. He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs, chest. Sarah flinches. She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER. She pushes his hand away and opens the door. Reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her. Hard.
(continuing) Do exactly what I say. Exactly. Don't move un- less I say. Don't make a sound unless I say. Do you understand? As he speaks he is locking the door and fastening Sarah's seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would for a child. She doesn't answer.
(continuing/ shouting) Do you understand?
I'm here to help you. Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416... Sarah stares numbly at his outstretched hand. With zero strength she automatically returns his handshake.
(continuing) Assigned to protect you. You've been targetted for termination.
No. But you will. It's very important that you live. Sarah closes her eyes, as if to shut it all out.
Not a man. A Terminator. Cyber Dynamics Model 101.
Not a robot. Cyborg. Cybernetic Organism. They have to yell over the roar of air through the broken windshield.
Just a second. Keep your head down.
Good cover. (pause) Alright. Listen. The Terminator's an infil- tration unit. Part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, mircoprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough... He pauses as they slide around another corner.
(continuing) But outside, it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair...blood. Grown for the cyborgs.
(cutting her off) Pay attention. The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
No. Not yet. Not for about forty years. Reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car. Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit too cool.
One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff.
Right. They come to a red light and Reese stops.
(coldly) Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do. Don't...do that...again. He wipes his hand on his pants.
(slow, but intense) Listen. Understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead. Sarah slump in utter resignation.
Maybe. With these weapons... I don't know.
There's so much...
There was a war. A few years from now. Nuclear war. The whole thing. All this-- His gesture includes the car, the city, the world.
(continuing) --everythingis gone. Just gone. There were survivors. Here. There. Nobody knew who started it. (pause) It was the machines.
Defense network computer. New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination. Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military briefing, quieter.
(continuing) Didn't see the war. I was born after, in the ruins. Grew up there. Starving. Hiding from the H-K's.
Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm. Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto- matic-pricing marks on product packages.
(continuing) Burned in by laser scan. (pause) Some of us were kept alive... to work. Loading bodies. The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out forever... The helicopter moves overhead. Its searchlight illum- inates the car interior, moves on. Before the rotor sound fads, Reese starts the car.
(continuing) ...but there was one man...who taught us to fight. To storm the wire of the camps. To smash those metal mother- fuckers into junk. He turned it around...he brought us back from the brink. (pause) His name is Connor. John Connor... your son, Sarah. Your unborn son. Sarah stared at him.
(yelling) Steer! Holding the gun is both hands he leans out the window, still keeping the throttle mashed down. Sarah grabs the wheel, fighting to control the car.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
(through speaker) That's right.
Then I was assigned Recon/ Security, last two years, under John Connor.
SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified Series
Yes.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence. We captured the lab complex. Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through. They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
(recorded) ...It's just him and me. CUT WIDE revealing Sarah, Silberman, Vukovich and Traxler watching a monitor sitting amid incredible paperwork clutter on a desk top.
(recorded/con- trolling his hostility) You go naked. Something about the field generated by a living organism. Nothing dead will go.
(recorded) I didn't build the fucking thing.
(recorded) Surrounded by living tissue.
(recorded) Most official records were lost in the war. The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother. Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures. The Terminator was just being systematic. C.U. - REESE, ON SCREEN, as he goes on.
(recorded, con- tinuing) You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me?
(recorded/voice rising) Then why am I talking to you? Get out. ON SARAH, DOLLYING SLOWLY IN TO C.U. as we hear Reese begin to shout.
Who is in authority here? C.U. REESE, ON SCREEN, as he looks straight at the camera.
(recorded) You still don't get it. He'll find her. That's what he does. All he does... MEDIUM ON VUKOVICH, gesturing to Silberman, who is near the machine, to kill it.
(recorded, con- tinuing) You can't stop him. He'll wade through you... C.U. - REESE, ON SCREEN, rising partway out of his chair, yelling.
(recorded, continuing) ...reach down her throat, and pull her fucking heart out... The screen goes black. Vukovich has cut off the tape.
Let's get off the road.
You cold?
Come here. She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each other with the blanket covering both of them.
Kyle.
White light. Pain. Like being ripped inside out... slowly. Like being born, maybe. Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.
I caught one, back there.
It's not bad. Sarah sits up and turns toward him.
It's okay. Forget it.
(looking at the wound) See. Missed everything. Passed through the meat. Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.
What?
About my height. He has your-- (winces) ...damn...he has your eyes. Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back to work.
(thoughtful) You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.
John never said much about him. He dies. Even before the war...
I volunteered.
It was an honor. A chance to meet the legend. Sarah Connor. Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid. When you were in hiding, before the war. She stops taping. She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.
I'm sure.
Ow! No, it's okay. It's better tight.
You'll learn.
John gave me a message for you. Made me memorize it. 'Sarah""...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you. For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive, or I will never exist.' That's all. Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real to her. Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.
(continuing) Good field-dressing.
Sleep. It'll be light soon.
About what?
Alright. (pause) You stay down by day, but at night you can move around. The H-K's use infra-red so you still have to watch out. But they're not too bright. John taught us ways to dust them them. That's when the infiltra- tors started to appear. The Terminators were the newest, the worst... During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving black. A ROTOR ROAR fades up.
We used them to spot Terminators. Sarah groans as she straightens her legs.
(to Sarah) Rad tubes?
Bag some Z's?
(pushing him out) Yours is over there. Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room, Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain. A bunch of kids are running around and throwing water at each other with paper cups. Reese shambles through them like a zombie. He stands among the children, an alien in this land without fear. He watches people at picnic tables laughing and listening to portable music. Kids squeal. Dogs bark.
Aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this?
Why? Sarah point to the directory page lying on the table.
What about it?
Molecular-memory.
(uneasy) That's the way it was told to me. Sarah's fear has been replaced by excitement.
(very cold) Tactically dangerous. We lay low.
That's not my mission.
Let's go. Time to move out.
(warning tone) Sarah! She dashes down a footpath among the trees, clutching her sign. Reese follows her into the woods.
(a whisper) I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this... He gestures at their surroundings.
(continuing) It's...like some dream. This...this... He touches the grass, the trunk of a tree.
(continuing) ...and you...all so...beauti- ful. It hurts, Sarah. More than death. He looks are her beseechingly.
(continuing) Don't you understand...it's all gone! Sarah puts her arm around him. She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.
Is this enough?
Later. I'm going out for materiel. Keep this. He hands her the .38 he took off the detective. She takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes that she has A LOADED GUN IN HER HAND, without the slightest idea of how to use it. She lays it gently on the dresser. As an afterthought, she turns it with one finger so that it is pointing the other way. Sarah moves the curtain slightly and looks outside.
(preoccupied) Plastique. There are also boxes of shotgun shells, road flares, tape, scissors, pans, a strainer and many other odd utensils, substances, chemicals.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable. I learned howto make it when I was a kid. Sarah looks a bit stricken as she contemplates the evening ahead.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this. Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
That's good. Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
Hot dogs?
My whole life has been combat.
Not possible.
We'll head out at 0200. That gives you four hours to sleep if you want. I'll finish.
Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything. In case they send another one.
No. I'm not. Several beats before Sarah speaks again. Her eyes seem luminous in the dark.
Good fighters.
Someone?
(mechanically) No. (pause) Never. He looks away, outside the window
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
It's better that way.
John Connor gave me a picture of you once. I never knew why. It was very old. Torn. Faded. You were young, like you are now. You weren't smiling...just a little sad... I always wondered what you were thinking at that second. He closes his eyes, reaches toward her. His fingertips trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.
(continuing) I memorized every line, every curve... He opens his eyes, looking right at hers.
(continuing) Sarah, I came across time for you. I love you. I always have. Sarah is quietly overwhelmed. Reese looks away.
(continuing) I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said...
(uncompre- hending) Ticklish? Sarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME. After a moment Reese looks down, puzzled.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
(whispering) Listen to the dogs.
Light it now. Sarah has been holding a BIC LIGHTER near the tip of a fuse. She thumbs the flame on. The fuse catches as Reese twists the wires and the engine starts to turn over.
Switch places with me. She slides over him while he keeps the hammer down.
(weakly) Sarah.
(weakly) Cover...our footsteps... He sags, sliding down the wall. She pulls him up. Half-carries him into the maze of machines. The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES, SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing mindlessly. Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to support him.
(faintly) Leave me here. Sarah crouches beside him. Grabs his shirt front. Yells over the machines.
(shouting) Run! He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away. Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator advances.
(over his shoulder) Run, damn it! She hesitates, backing away. The cyborg swings at Reese
","Give me the short version.
No shit. Traxler turns to a passing DETECTIVE.
(interrupting) That can't be right. That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon. Traxler slips something off his clipboard and hands it to the Lieutenant.
(pondering) You gotta be kidding me. The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one. A one-day pattern killer.
No comment. He and Traxler enter their office and shut the door.
(nodding ab- sently) I know.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Send a unit.
Call her.
Call her again. Traxler picks up the phone and begins to dial her number as Vukovich sets down his coffee cup, unwraps a stick of gum and pops it in his mouth.
(continuing) Got a cigarette?
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
(heading for the door) To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name. Maybe the jackals can help us out for once. He looks at his watch, then straightens his tie.
(continuing) If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us. (pause) How do I look?
(on phone) I won't. Now just relax. Where are you? (pause) Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
(on phone) Alright, Ms. Connor. Listen carefully. You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there. Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom. I'll be there in a few minutes. He hangs up and grabs his coat, motioning to Traxler.
Let's roll.
Let's see how this guy likes playing hard-ball.
(shouting) What the fuck is going on? TWO LAPD UNITS arrive behind them. He motions to the nearest one.
(continuing) Cover the alley in back. He heads for the inferno at a run.
(shouting) Go! Go! He's got her.
Here, drink some of this...
They've already been identi- fied. There's no doubt. Sarah begins to cry again, slowly and very quickly.
(gently) Sarah. (pause) Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man. I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you. Do you feel up to it?
(leaning forward) Shut up.
Sarah, this is body armor. Out TAC guys wear it. It'll stop a 12 gauge round. This other individual must've had one under his coat. Sarah want to believe him. God help her if he's wrong.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep. It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Go ahead. You're safe. There're thirty cops in this building.
(quietly) He'd better be.
Stay here. He turns the locking knob and slams the door. Leaving her alone. She flinches as more SHOTS SOUND. CLOSER.
(continuing) You just keep her alive. Do what you have to. Reese snatches the gun and the keys and runs on. C.U. - VUKOVICH watching them go.
","
(without inflec- tion) Nice night for a walk. They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.
Nothing clean. Right.
Your clothes. Give them to me. The punks exchange glances, dismayed.
(coldly) Now.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
All. The clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile.
(evenly) Wrong. He raises the barrel and pulls the trigger. The gun THUNDERS.
Sarah Connor?
This is One-Four-Three. West- bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor. I was told she is here. Can I see her, please?
Where is she?
I'll come back. He turns and walks out through the front doors. ANGLE PAST DESK SERGEANT, F.G. - ON FRONT DOORS, the officer is absorbed in paperwork, not watching as a pair of lights get BRIGHTER outside the doors. RAPIDLY. He glances up at the last second as the glare falls fully on him. CRASH! Several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car smashes into the foyer. It blasts through the sergeant's booth, crushing him in the wreckage.
Fuck you, asshole. He returns to his scan.
","...and three aaand four! And that's it ladies! Now, didn't that feel good? The group collapses ensemble. A chorus of groans.
Let's think positive or next time I'll play the FM version. Ginger walks over to Sarah as the class disperses. Marco is leaning on the wall next to Sarah, who is enjoying the attention.
You're wasting your time, kiddo. Let's go. She grabs Sarah by the arm and pulls her out the door. Sarah catches a glimpse of Marco's expression over her shoulder as the door closes.
That guy's a jerk. I did you a favor.
(continuing) You think somebody's gonna do this for you? Look at those shriveled bi's. And you haven't worked lat's or ab's since Wednesday.
(softening) Come here, wimp. She leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's bad for the other guys' discipline. Sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak.
Alright, warm-ups are over. Back to work, Bunky. Ginger readadjusts her headphones as the two girls walk away.
Hello?
(covering mouth- piece) Great. Sarah hold up another one.
Great.
(advisory tone) Alright, the beige one.
(same advisory tone) Don't wear the beige one. Sarah gathers up the blouses and walks out.
(studying their reflection) Better than mortal man deserves. Sarah grins and goes into the other room.
Not lately. Did you check messages?
(groaning) Totally nauseating. Sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits contentedly as she looks for her purse. Ginger has been rewinding the message tape. She punches PLAY and a MALE VOICE is heard.
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
I'll break his kneecaps. Sarah resignedly slips Pugsley off her shoulders.
(as Sarah exits) We will, kiddo.
Shoo. Go on. I'll make a belt out of you. Pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on stalks of celery.
