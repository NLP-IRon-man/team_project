Laughter echoes from the chairs behind him.He yells forward.

What if everyone went home?
We need to get down from here. We can't just sit up here. Why isn't the goddamn chair moving, Dan? What the hell?!

Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses his forehead into hers. Her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves.
He wasn't going to listen to me.
You're sorry? Maybe if you hadn't fucked with our thing... maybe if you had just stayed home and not forced yourself into every aspect of his life... maybe my best friend
They only speak to be speaking.

She can't quite hear him.

As she makes her way she spots a tree... with bright red blood splayed out in the snow around it. Cautiously she slows herself down.
","I don't see her.
I'm cute.Just then, JASON (a ski mountain employee) approaches thefront of the line and excuses the employee working the chair.
Dude.
-GIRLfriends. Say ""girlfriends"".
Parker, you've so got this.
`Cause you're a girl.
He's not going for it.
Minimum.
She had to come skiing with us? Dan looks back at him, offended.
I don't. I don't mind. Don't mind at all.
For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes.
It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything.They see Parker hand Jason something. He pockets it and sheglides her way back to the end of the line.She looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and thenexcitedly waves. Proud of herself.
You did great.
I would have asked for change.
I would have definitely asked him for change.
I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. ""Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!"" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here. Dan looks back to Parker.
(to no one imparticular)
Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck.
(to Parker) Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?
Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.

Oh no. She broke the rule.
Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights?
So it doesn't bother you when I do this?Lynch rocks the chair back and forth.Parker grabs hold of the safety bar.
Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing.With a lurch, the chair starts moving forward again and thewhirring sound of the cables above them start up again.Applause is heard from all of the other chairs.

Need some help?
Woah! Shit, man! I was just trying to help!Instantly, Dan moves over to Lynch's aid. Parker followsslowly behind him. She's clearly not too good on her board.
I was seriously just trying to help. I mean, how could I even
Yeah, I'm fine.
Joe.
(to his friends) I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.
Seriously, that guy was such a dick.
Last one to the bottom is buying dinner! He eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass.

Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill
No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point.
-no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that.
Exactly. Remember? I was like ""Hey man, why doesn't Parker come
You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, ""Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing...""
(to his friends) Wait up. Lynch walks over to Shannon while Dan and Parker move towards
(teasing) No way.
Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes.

Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or
Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen?She laughs and shakes her head no.
Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good. Shannon gets serious.
Whew. You! That's so like you!
(to Dan) Remember ""429"".
Just remember ""429"". (to himself)
Seriously. For a hundred bucks
Wachusett still has night skiing.

There's a Papa Gino's on our way

Don't you mean, ""baby""?Parker starts laughing.
(yelling to the sky)

I told you that?
Yeah, seriously. That's kinda spooky, Dan.
The chick on the Jaws poster was
I don't know. She was naked. Naked chicks are hot.
That's why I only swim in pools.
Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.
But they say that when you jump
(defensive) What?
The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever.
Shut-up. The wind starts blowing again and Parker nestles close to Dan.
Come on now! This is messed up.
I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie.
What did you say to the guy?
Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this.
This is so messed up.
Free lift tickets.
We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even
That makes two of us.
Well, what do you want me to do? I gotta go.
It's just the safety bar. It doesn't really do anything anyway.

I'm pissing.Lynch lifts the safety bar up, whips out his business andstarts to pee off the side of the chair into the snow below
Ban me from the mountain? You couldn't pay me to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming back.Lynch finishes his business. LYNCH (cont'd) There. Much better.A low thunder clap rolls in across the trees and the chillingwind picks up.

What is this asshole doing? The Snow Cat switches back into drive.
Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the
Crunch Berries...

Hmm...guess that leaves me. I'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh?Silence.

You can't get frost bite that fast. It's only been- what, like...how long has it been? A few hours, tops?Dan inspects Parker's face. It's tough to see in the dark,
Dan, it's a far drop. I don't know.

How are you going to find your way in the dark?
Dan, say something. Are you alright? More quiet breaths from below. Finally...
Oh, shit.
OK. Alright. You gotta stay
(to Dan below) Buddy, can you move at all?
Here you go, Dan. I'm throwing mine down.

Alright. Hold on.
I can't even do a pull-up.
Even if I made it across to the
Shit, that's far.He and Parker just stare at it. LYNCH (cont'd) Just. Just give me a second.He starts taking deep breaths. Trying to psyche himself up.
Parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death.
It's funny. But I was never afraid of heights, until like...right now.
Shh!They listen again.
It's alright man. It's just a
Just relax. When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England?
Parker- coming through with the
Nothing. Just be quiet.He psyches himself up again and starts to rise up.
Please stop talking.He puts one foot up on the top of the chair back...but itslips off to the side.
It's just a dog. That's all it is.


I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off.Parker is terrified. LYNCH (cont'd) Just try and cover your face. Try and stay warm.
I'm trying man, I'm trying.

Please no. Please no...He starts to pull himself back to the chair, quickly.
Don't look down.
Don't look down there, Parker. The camera booms up and above them. As it tilts down at


I should...try and...
You can't be fucking serious.
He said he could do it. You didn't
You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him!
Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I
What? Say it.Parker looks at him, uncertain.

You know what? If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass

And it's not fair that my best friend is DEAD!Parker begins to sob.
-Fuck you.
5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call that girl when we get home. And you know what? I'm gonna marry her. No messing around. I'm just gonna be like ""Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift. Will you marry me?"" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve.
She will. Shannon's got a great


I will.
Says who?

What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's?
She won't starve to death and you're not going to die.
Your frost-bite. It's getting...worse.She starts to touch her face.
Don't. It's bad.

They'll fix me, too then. Just
Can you please just think ONE positive thing? Please!
(to the sky)
If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you.
Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this.
Shit, I thought you stopped breathing...
Nothing. She studies his eyes. Clearly something is very wrong. LYNCH (cont'd) How about you help me up again and we try and get out of here?
I have no strength.
What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength.
Even if it was a foot deeper- it
Nothing. Let's sit and do nothing.
How am I supposed to answer that?
I had a serious girlfriend once.

She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates
Same old shit. (then) No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named ""Dean"" had left her notes and shit.
I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention.

Yup. Told her to go laugh with ""Dean the Frat guy"". I was out.
Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I
There was nothing either of us could have done.

Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little...
But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit.
Help me up.

Rrruh! He pushes off hard and grabs on to the cabling.
Shit! Hold on, just hold on!
Rrrugh!

(through gritted teeth) Got it.
No. No it's not.Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positionshimself over the other chair.

Shit.Parker needs to yell to hear him now.

Sorry. (then) She's the one who said we'd be here for ""a week""!
Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder.
Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at them. Dan's head snaps up.
Parker takes off her helmet and throws it down.
Finally.
I don't want to die up here.
Don't leave me.
It lands sticking up straight in the snow. DAN (cont'd)
we drop (without cutting) from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below.
LYNCH (cont'd) If we go to pieces we're never gonna get through this, OK?
Moments pass with only their breathing.
You can too. Remember Jenny Bluth? She fucking did it. You can do it.
What's going on up there? You guys?
Parker maneuvers herself to hold Joe's legs..Joe tries to move into a standing position, but panics.
Lynch tries to control the panic.

Parker feels terrible. She puts her hand on his shoulder.
LYNCH (cont'd) (quietly) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Parker.
Lynch makes something up...but continues to have no expression in his words. Despite his talk, his spirit is shattered.
Why not? Steve's a good name for a dog.
(beat) And so will you. So will we.He puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying toshield the wind.
Her movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts upright as iffrom a `falling nightmare'.Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth frantically
Just don't touch your face, OK? When we get out of here, we'll get you to a doctor right away and they'll fix it.
LYNCH (cont'd) Alright. Look. If I can get to that chair...two back...I could make it to the ladder on that pole. I think I could make it down.
Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still breathing. It appears she is not.
No, post-high school. Freshmen year.
No. I dumped her. We were in the cafeteria, right? And I was sitting facing her, facing the wall...and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me. And I

He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.
He starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to Parkerone more time.The chair has settled down.
He assesses the situation.It's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladderand he is winded beyond belief.
Finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a THUD into the snow.
The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill.

She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure. Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding. Parker and the pack leader lock eyes. Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food. Back to his family. Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain side. She is free.

From their POV the chair lift is still moving but the line is empty. They start to move to the empty lift line when...

Lynch bites his severely chapped lips.

She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone. Parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can.
All that she can do is clutch the ground. And then... Another car approaches in the distance. She holds her hand up weakly.
","The shift change is late. Just wait. PARKER O'NEIL (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard) sighs and stares back at the lift lane.
We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it.Lynch smiles at Parker.
Shit.
It's cool, it's cool. (to Parker) Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him-
Parker, listen, listen. It's so easy. All you do is tell the guy that you and your friends-
-you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets.He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it inParker's hand.
You've got this. You can totally do this.
The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no.

Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it?
-Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more. Lynch sighs, then changes the subject.
You said you didn't mind?

Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you...

I'm just not a `pet name' guy.
See? At least I don't call you ""O'Neil"".
Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck. (then, forced) Sweetie.
You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike.

I'm tough.

Are they fucking kidding?
(angered out of panic) Will you stop?!
Me? Nothing!
I didn't do anything! He knows we're still up here.
They just lost power or something.
I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night?
We won't be stuck here all night.
