txt,"Who are you? You've come from a hospital.
He's not a doctor. He's a patient.
It began as rioting. And right from the beginning, you knew something bad was going on because the rioters were killing people. And then it wasn't on the TV anymore. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. We all guessed it was a virus. An infection. You didn't need a doctor to tell you that. It was the blood.
Yours will be dead too.
You'll go and come back.
If there's anyone in there who isn't human...
Anyone.
They died peacefully. You should be grateful.
We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight. Jim nods. He isn't sure what he wants to say.
We'll sleep in the same room. It's safer.
Were you bitten?
Were you bitten? Jim looks at her. Selena is still holding her machete at the ready.
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?
Mark? Jim turns to Mark. He is standing in the middle of the room. Stepped away from the window. The Girl's blood is on his arm - and he is wiping it away... ...off the skin... where a long scratch cut wells up fresh blood. A moment. Then Mark looks at Selena, as if slightly startled.
Get that cleaned off. Jim picks up the rag and hurriedly starts to wipe the Infected's blood from around his neck.
Do you have any clothes here?
Then get them. And get dressed. We have to leave, now. With practiced speed, Selena starts to open the kitchen cupboards, selecting packets of biscuits and cans from the shelves, and stuffing them into her backpack.
More infected will be coming. They always do.
The blood.
Five days. Or six. Does it matter? Jim says nothing.
He was full of plans. Long-distance weapons, so they don't get close. A newsagent's with a metal grill, so you can sleep. Petrol bombs, so the blood doesn't splash. Selena looks at Jim dispassionately.
Got a plan yet, Jim? You want us to find a cure and save the world? Or fall in love and fuck? Selena looks away again.
Plans are pointless. Staying alive is as good as it gets. Silence.
Shhh. She has seen something... A line of tower blocks some distance away, standing against the night sky. In one of them, hanging in the window of one of the highest stories, colored fairy lights are lit up, blinking gently.
Need a break?
No. They continue a few steps.
What's up?
Bad?
Why didn't you say something before?
(going through the bag) You've got no fat on you, and all you've had to eat is sugar. So you're crashing. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot we can do about that...
...except pump you full painkillers, and give you more sugar to eat. She holds up a bottle of codeine tablets, and passes it to Jim.
As for the sugar: Lilt or Tango?
Actually, I did have a can of Sprite, but... Suddenly there is a loud scream, coming from somewhere lower down the building. Jim and Selena both make a grab for their weapons.
Quiet. The scream comes again. The noise is chilling, echoing up the empty stairwell. But there is something strange about it. The noise is human, but oddly autistic. It is held for slightly too long, and stops abruptly.
That's an infected. Then, the sound of metal scraping, clattering the blockade.
They're in.
Come on!
Let us in! The door opens a fraction, on the chain. The face of a girl appears. She is fourteen, pale, solemn-faced.
Selena. Frank beams, and suddenly he seems much less frightening and imposing. If anything, he is just as nervous as Jim and Selena.
Shall we? Jim and Selena take the sofa. Hannah stays standing.
We're grateful.
And you haven't seen any people outside? Frank's eyes flick to Hannah.
Didn't come back.
It's a good set-up.
Very spruce.
Uh-huh. Jim sits on the armchair, and Selena moves to look at a picture on the wall - the photo of Frank's family and the black cab.
They're desperate. Probably need us more than we need them.
Good people?
Well, that's nice. But you should be more concerned about whether they're going to slow you down.
I'd leave them behind.
Yeah.
Then you're going to wind up getting yourself killed. A moment. Then Selena stands.
I'm going to get some sleep.
Sure.
And I mean sure. Good night, Jim. She exits, leaving Jim alone.
There haven't been any broadcasts for weeks.
We. A moment. Then Frank gives a short, embarrassed laugh.
I wasn't -
If it's a recording, for all we know the soldiers who made it are dead.
And that stuff about the answer to infection. There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.
Maybe they've got nothing at all.
We could die trying.
It's the most direct route to the other side of the river.
They're running from the infected. As if in answer, the howls of the Infected echo down the tunnel. Hannah desperately positions the jack underneath the cab, as the rates run over her face.
(straining with the
Whoa! Stop the cab! Stop the cab!
Un. Believable. She opens the door to the cab, holding her machete.
This place hasn't been looted. It's a gold mine.
Food and drink is what's in there. And we need it. Selena gets out.
I've been living off Mars Bars and Coke for two weeks. I need some tinned fruit.
Let's shop.
I'll have you, you, you, you...
Don't take anything we need to cook. Jim looks at the item in his hand. It is caviar.
Ugh. If I never see chocolate again, it'll be too soon. A beat, as something catches her eye. She whips it off the shelf.
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange, of course.
Or Yorkies, obviously.
We could have a problem here.
Stay close, Jim.
You heard.
Where are you going? Jim points his bat in the direction of the cafe.
We've got enough food.
Find anything. Jim says nothing.
Find anything, Jim?
Oh my God, yes. I can taste the vitamin C. I can feel it in my blood.
You were thinking that you'll never hear another piece of original music ever again. You'll never read a book that isn't already written. Or see a film that isn't already shot. Jim smiles.
No... I was thinking I was wrong.
All the death, all the shit - it doesn't really mean anything for Frank and Hannah. Because she's got her dad, and he's got his daughter, so... it's okay. A beat.
(looking back at Jim) I was wrong when I told you that staying alive is as good as it gets.
...Was it?
(smiling back at Jim) Sorry.
No fire crews to put it out. We see what they are looking at...
Don't. We might attract the wrong kind of attention.
Or overrun. Frank flicks the radio on - there is only static. He switches it off again.
I don't like this. I think we should go.
Frank.
Yes.
Jim... (breaking into a run) Jim, he's infected!
(holding Hannah back) Jim! But Jim is frozen, holding his baseball bat. Frank screams again. Then drops to his knees. Hannah struggles with Selena, trying to get to Frank.
Jim! Jim is still frozen, baseball bat half-raised.
She's lost her dad. That's how she is.
Shut up, Jim. Just shut up. I don't want her to fucking cope. I want her to be okay. And when Hannah had her dad, it was all okay. Remember? And when it was okay for them, it was okay for us. And now it's all fucked.
Fuck you!
Wha...
But we...
You can't do this to her! She's only fourteen!
You need to give me a moment with Hannah. Alone. Clifton nods - he seems a little dazed.
He wants us to dress up nice. She picks up two of the dresses Bedford has thrown - the red dresses.
But if you want us to change, you'll have to get out of the room. A moment.
(calm, powerful) It's just fucking polite. Another moment. Then Clifton nods. Acquiesces.
Eat them. Hannah hesitates.
No. I'm making you not care. Locked eyes with Selena, Hannah raises the first pill to her mouth. Then the next. The door behind opens - revealing the soldiers. Clifton sees what is happening.
Jim.
Hannah! Hannah! We have to get out of here! Mailer vomits blood into Clifton's face.
Oh Jesus, Jesus, Hannah, stay with it, stay with it.
Hannah!
Hannah!
...Jim? Jim moves forwards, and kisses her. Simply. Hard. Then pulls back, leaving a trace of blood on her lips. Behind Jim's back, the door opposite, in the corridor, silently swings open.
I thought...I thought you were... Jim moves forwards, and they kiss. Passionately. Then Jim breaks off.
Hannah! Stop! It's okay!
He's not infected!
It's a long story. They are interrupted by the sounds of Infected howling.
We have to get out of here.
Jim!
We're going to crash! The gates loom. Hannah speeds towards them.
We're going to crash!
","Ow... His voice is hoarse, his mouth dry. Massaging his throat, he walks to the door.
Hello? Aside from a quiet rush of wind, there is silence. No traffic, no engines, no movement. Not even birdsong.
...Hello? Immediately, the four heads flick around. Infected. And the next moment, there is the powerful thump of a door at the far end of the gallery. Jim whirls to the source as the Infected below start to move. The door thumps again - another stunningly powerful blow, the noise echoing around the chamber. Confused, fist closing around his bag of soft drinks, Jim steps onto the gallery, facing the door... ...and it smashes open. Revealing an Infected Priest - who locks sight on Jim, and starts to sprint.
Father? The Priest is half way across the gallery
Father, what are you... And now the moonlight catches the Priest's face. Showing clearly: the eyes. The blood smeared and collected around his nose, ears, and mouth. Darkened and crusted, accumulated over days and weeks. Fresh blood glistening.
Jesus! In a movement of pure instinct, Jim swings the bag just as the Priest is about to reach him - and connects squarely with the man's head.
Oh, that, was bad, that was bad... I shouldn't have done that... He breaks into a run...
Shit.
I'm a bicycle courier. I was riding a package from Farringdon to Shaftesbury Avenue. A car cut across me... and then I wake up in hospital, today... I wake up and I'm hallucinating, or...
Jim.
Where are your families?
No... No! I'm going to find them. They live in Greenwich. I can walk. (heading for the exit) I'm going to... to go and...
(pulling at the grill) Yes! I'll go and come back.
I understand.
I understand. Selena shoots a glance at Jim. Jim is gazing at the house.
I'm not grateful. Jim's words hang a moment. Then Mark talks, simply, unemotionally, matter-of-fact throughout.
My old room was at the end of the landing. You two take it. I'll sleep down here.
(draining the carton, and giving it a shake) It's empty.
It's Mr. Bridges... Selena turns to Jim. She is hyperventilating too, but there is control and steel in her voice.
He lives four doors down... Jim turns to the Girl sprawled half way through the window.
That's his daughter...
No... No! I wasn't!
No!
(fazed, frightened of her) I... I don't know. I think so.
The blood was everywhere. On me, on you, and...
How long had you known him?
Let's hope we don't have to get out of here in a hurry. She begins to climb through.
(completely out of breath) No. You?
I do need a break, by the way. Selena nods. They stop on the stairs. Jim slips off his backpack and sits, pulling a face as he does so...
Nothing. She gives him a cut-the-crap expression.
I've got a headache.
Pretty bad.
Because I didn't think you'd give a shit. A moment, where it's unclear how Selena will react to this. Then she slips off her own backpack.
Jesus!
(out of breath, barely able to speak) I can't. Selena continues, and Jim looks over the edge of the stairwell, to the landing below... ...where the two Infected appear, tearing around the corner.
I'm Jim.
This is your place, then. Hannah nods.
It's nice. Hannah nods again. Frank re-enters. Frank is beaming, holding the creme de menthe, and four wine glasses.
There aren't any others in the building? Frank shakes his head.
Yes. Fine.
It's fine.
I'll take the living room.
Good night, Frank. Frank smiles, and heads to his bedroom.
Very shredded.
So what do you make of them?
...I think they're good people.
Yeah.
Right. Because if they slowed you down...
In a heartbeat.
I wouldn't.
Selena - you think I don't get it. But I do get it. And I know I'd be dead already if I hadn't met you. Selena hesitates at the door - then turns.
No, look - I mean thank you.
Good night. Jim walks around the room, blowing out the candles. He leaves one burning beside the sofa.
Morning.
(looking at the pans) They're all empty...
Right.
It's a recording? Frank switches the radio off, and produces a map of Britain, which he opens on the table.
The North...
Maybe they've got a cure.
Get there how?
Then we should go the indirect route. The one in broad daylight. That isn't underground.
I knew this was a shit idea. You know why? Because it was really obviously a shit idea. Driving into a dark tunnel, full of smashed cars and broken glass is really fucking obviously a shit idea. As Jim speaks, out of the gloom, caught in the headlights, a huge pile of cars appears, stretching across the full width of the tunnel. Frank slams his foot down on the accelerator.
Oh no.
The world's worst place to get a flat.
...You heard that?
Holy shit. A tide of rats is rushing under their feet.
(at the Infected) Fuck you! Frank slams his foot down, and they tear off.
You're getting out?
Wait!
It's okay. I think you can eat this stuff raw.
It isn't any crap. It's whisky. It might be good to have.
Jesus Christ. We're never going to be able to get out of London.
...What?
We don't have any cheeseburgers.
No. Selena lets it pass - and the moment is broken as Frank stands with the can.
Who's unbelievably hungry?
Let's have a picnic.
(cracking a bun in half) These are great. They're like huge biscuits. He offers half to Hannah, who takes a bite.
You know what I was thinking? Selena considers this a moment.
That's what you were thinking.
About what?
Uh-huh. You stole my thought. Selena leans over and gives Jim a light kiss on the cheek.
(slightly surprised, but
Nor can I. It doesn't feel safe, outdoors like this.
I know. I noticed that too. (reaching over and shaking
How did you manage to get to sleep? Selena gives a dozy grumble, then sits up, reaches into her backpack, and pulls out several bottles of pills. She hands one of them to Jim.
(inspecting the bottle) Valium. Great. Not only will it get us to sleep, but if we get attacked during the night, we won't even care. (pops the lid) Two each?
Fuck you!
(confused, semi-conscious) What... Frank is sitting beside him - and we see for the first time that Frank is awake, keeping guard over them while they sleep.
(mumbled, half-asleep
Here you go, Frank. This is how you catch dew. I'm covered in the fucking stuff.
Bloody hell...
But, the whole of Manchester. The whole city...
It can't be...
Try the horn.
It looks deserted.
They didn't all leave. Inside, several body bags lie, buzzing with flies. Selena stands several feet away, by one of the packing cases. She pulls out a tangle of camouflage webbing, then lets it drop back inside.
Yes.
We were hoping for...
I didn't know what to imagine, so... We just feel lucky to have found you.
You're keeping him alive?
And has he?
...So how is she?
Hey, don't...do that. Look, Hannah... Hannah's what Frank said she was. Tough. Strong. And just like me, just like you, she will cope...
Look. We're grateful. Very grateful for your protection, and just to have found other people. But if we're going to stay here with you, you're going to have to stop your men from -
A boy. I killed a boy.
Yes.
What?
Get up. Get up!
We've got to get out of here!
(hauling them up) We're leaving. Now! NOW!
... Quarantine? Then the door to the cellar bursts open, revealing Mitchell and Jones.
Hannah! Selena! He tries another door. Open.
That was longer than a heartbeat.
Listen to me. I've got to tell you - I've got to tell you. The world isn't fucked. It's going to be okay. We've got a chance, if we can get to... Selena interrupts him, by continuing the kiss. And Jim responds. As, behind him, a small figure in a red dress slip into the room. Then a vase smashes over the back of Jim's head.
Ow! He reels back, and Hannah is on him, jumping on his back, hitting him with her fists.
(holding the back of his
Just fucking do it!
Jesus. Not the curtains too.
You looked all right in this, you know. Selena ignores him. Jim walks to the front door and opens it. Pull back to reveal...
Do you think he saw us this time?
","Jim and Selena. Good to meet you. And this is my daughter, Hannah. (turning to Hannah) ...Come on, sweetheart. Say hello. Hannah takes a step into the room, but says nothing.
So... so this is great. Just great. It calls for a celebration.
Yes, her creme de menthe. Great. Look, sit, please. Get comfortable. Sit tight while I get it. Frank exits. Selena, Jim and Hannah all stand, until Selena gestures at the sofa.
There! I know it isn't much but... well, cheers!
Normally we keep the windows covered at night, because the light attracts them. But when we saw your petrol station fire, we knew it had to be survivors... So we hooked up the Christmas tree lights. Like a beacon. Finished with the sofa, he sits on the armchair.
Well, we're grateful you came. I was starting to really worry. Like I say, we haven't seen any sign of anyone normal for a while now.
We haven't left the block for more than two weeks. Stayed right here. Only sensible thing to do. Everyone who went out...
And there's two hundred flats here. Most of them have a few cans of food, or cereal, or something.
It isn't bad. He puts a hand on Hannah's shoulder, and gives it a squeeze.
We've got by, haven't we?
Have to empty it each morning. We just chuck it over the balcony... No mod cons here.
...Well, look, it's pretty late. I'm going to turn in. We've got a spare room. Are you and Selena...?
Oh, right. I mean, yes... So, good night then, anyway.
Morning, Jim.
Listen, have you got a minute?
We lost water pressure three weeks ago. For a while, I thought we'd be okay with the water in the other flats. The cistern and tanks. But it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe. You drink it, it evaporates, turns stagnant...
It hasn't rained in over a week. Frank sits, watching Jim.
You can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation. Trap it somehow. I saw it on TV once and I've been experimenting, but I can't get it to work, and... you don't happen to... Jim shakes his head.
You'd never think it. Needing rain so badly... Not in fucking England... (he breaks off) Jim, we don't have enough water for and Selena. A moment.
No. It's not what you think.
There's more. Listen.
Then it just repeats.
It's a recording. But this is where it's telling us to go. Frank points to the location described.
The way things are, we might need two or three days to get up there.
Sound carries in this flat. Jerry- built, I suppose, and... me and Hannah do need you more than you need us.
It's okay. Look, it's the truth. I can't leave the block if it's just the two of us.
Yes. It's possible.
The only way to find out is to reach them.
Just so as you know. I don't take cheques or credit cards.
What do you think?
Let's just get it done.
Fuck. Frank jumps out of the cab, and shines his flashlight around the tunnel.
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.
You know what to do. Hannah immediately runs to the front of the cab and hunches down. Meanwhile, Frank unclips the spare and hauls it out. Jim and Selena stand at the back of the cab, weapons ready, shining their flashlights into the darkness. At the front of the cab, Hannah pumps the jack, but it is moving with aching slowness. At the back of the cab, Jim and Selena wait nervously. There is a noise from further down the tunnel, in the direction which they came. A scrabbling rush of movement - but too quiet to be humans. Jim and Selena exchange a glance.
(from the front of the
(as the rats rush around
Hannah, get out, get out! (to Jim and Selena) Just lift it! LIFT IT! Jim, Selena, and Frank get their hands under the side of the cab, and pull upwards. The cab rises. Hannah, with great skill and speed, fits the new tire, like a pit-stop mechanic at a grand prix.
Honey, you're a cab driver's daughter.
Mmm. Irradiated.
Put that back. We can't just take any crap.
Who's arguing about whisky? I'm saying, don't get a cheap blend. Frank takes a bottle of Lagavulin.
Single malt. Eighteen-year-old. Dark, full flavor. Jim starts to back his trolley away.
Warm, but not aggressive. Peaty after taste.
Don't you worry about that. I've sat twenty years in this seat. I've got my routes.
Okay. We either do this now, or we're walking.
If anything goes wrong, you just drive. You put your foot down. And go as far as you can. No response from Hannah.
You hear me, Hannah?
Okay. We're done. He lifts a hand to Hannah.
You're Ayrton Senna's bloody daughter.
Hey. Everyone turns.
Look over there.
No. I think they're doing just fine.
I think we're safe enough. A couple of moments pass.
Bloody hell. You must have needed a hell of a prescription for that lot.
Not for me, thanks.
All right, all right. Give her half of one.
Shh. You're having a bad dream, that's all. Jim's face relaxes a little.
(packing the spare away) Okay. Let's get rolling. (he checks his watch) If we make good time, we'll be there before midday.
It must be Manchester.
(hitting the windscreen
Okay, everyone. I think this is it.
What do you think?
Let's check it out.
Nothing. Nothing here. I can't believe it.
""We should go.""
(under his breath) Get out it.
I... I'm fine, honey. I'm sorry. I just lost my temper. I... He breaks off.
Hannah... Abruptly, the color is draining from his face.
Get away from me!
","I'm Major Henry West. Welcome. We've got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water. So you can all have a shower. You look like you need one. Jim, Selena, and tear-streaked Hannah gaze back at Henry blankly.
You heard our broadcast.
We must be a disappointment. You were hoping for a full brigade. An army base, with helicopters and field hospitals.
The answer to infection. Well, as I said, it's here. Though it may not be quite what you imagined.
You were lucky. The fire drove hundreds of infected out of Manchester. The surrounding area is teeming with them. Henry glances back at Jim.
But there's no need for you to worry. We're well protected here.
Three-sixty visibility. Flat terrain all around the house... Floodlights, which we've rigged up to a generator. Don't like to waste the fuel, but when we want to, we can turn night into day. Moving on...
High perimeter wall, which helps, and we've been lacing the grounds with trip wires and land mines. Henry indicates where Farrell, Smith and Davis can be seen, running a trip wire.
You wouldn't want to go mowing the lawn, but if they get in, we hear them.
Secondary to protection, our real job is to rebuild. Start again. Down here is the wood-fired boiler that provides us with hot water. Our first step to civilization. Then to a kitchen...
And here, the kitchen.
What are you cooking, Jones?
And finally... The laundry starts to billow - and with it we hear the sound of rushing movement. As a darkly stained sheet is ripped aside, an Infected is revealed only a few feet away. Jim jumps back, but Henry stays put - as the Infected is suddenly jerked backwards by a chain around its neck.
...meet Mailer. Mailer is uniformed. A soldier. Apart from the chain around his neck, he is gagged with a filthy and blood-blackened rag tied tight into his mouth.
Mailer, Jim. Jim, Mailer. Got infected three days ago. Mitchell managed to knock him out cold. Got a chain around his neck.
The idea was to learn something about infection. Have him teach me.
In a way.
Dinner's at seven. Don't forget to tell the girls. Henry exits, leaving Jim with Mailer. Mailer lunges at Jim - a moment between them. Then Jim exits.
So, what have we here? Tinned ham, tinned peas, and omelette. You've prepared a feast, Jones.
Absolutely. I was going to suggest a toast, but this omelette will do just as well. (cuts off a chunk of omelette and raises it) To new friends. Henry pops the omelette in his mouth, then promptly spits it out.
Jones, did you notice while cooking that these eggs are off?
(pushing his plate away) Get rid of it. Henry turns to Hannah as Jones sheepishly exits, carrying the omelette.
I don't suppose you can cook, can you? I can't tell you how badly we need someone who shows a little flair in the kitchen. Hannah ignore/is unaware of Henry's attempt to bring her out of her shell. Meanwhile, the soldiers start helping themselves to the other food on the table.
(to Jim and Selena) Have you met our new-age sergeant?
This is what I've seen in the four weeks since infection. People killing people. Which is much what I saw in the four weeks before infection, and the four weeks before that, and before that, as far back as I care to remember... People killing people. Which to my mind puts us in a state of normality right now. Selena turns to Hannah.
You must eat, Hannah.
Corporal, first point of order after an attack.
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.
Clear the bodies off the lawn. The rest of you go with him. The soldiers exit, leaving only Jim, Henry and Selena in the room. Selena is shaken, and won't meet Jim's eyes. Henry hands Selena her machete back.
My apologies. Selena takes the machete and exits, but Jim doesn't follow. Obviously there is something he wants to say to Henry.
Drink? Henry walks over to a drinks cabinet, and pours two brandies, waiting for Jim to speak.
Who have you killed?
Since it began, who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive now if you hadn't killed somebody.
A child?
But you had to. Otherwise he'd have killed you. Survival. I understand.
Eight days ago I found Jones with his gun in this mouth. He said he was going to kill himself because there was no future. What could I say to him? We kill all the infected or wait until they starve to death. And then what? What do nine men do except wait to die themselves?
And children mean a future.
I want to give you a chance. You can be with us, or not. Jim stares back at him. And Henry gazes at Jim, searching behind Jim's eyes. And understands what he finds.
Okay, Jim. Okay. Henry gives Jim's cheek a soft pat, then rises.
Shut up! Davis - you're coming with me!
Okay. Let's see if we can sidestep the cat-and-mouse bullshit. Henry opens fire.
Davis? The figure doesn't move. Henry approaches cautiously, gun raised, and finds...
Fine! Fine, you little bastard! Fucking die out here! Henry hauls out Davis's body, gets into the driver's seat, turning the ignition... ...but nothing is happening. Henry turns the key again, desperately. The motor doesn't even turn over. Reaching under the dashboard, he pulls out a handful of wires.
Jim. And at the moment, an Infected slams onto the windscreen, face against the glass. Henry shouts out of surprise and anger, lifting his gun, and fires at point-blank range, through the glass, into the Infected's face. The windscreen shatters, blown outwards. And now, where our view was obscured by rain-washed glass, we can see clearly... ...Infected, in the blockade, coming through the downpour, running towards the jeep. Henry opens fire and cuts them down.
You killed all my boys. Henry pulls the trigger - a single shot. Jim is hit in the stomach and falls backwards into Selena's arm.
What...Hannah! Hannah? The cab reverses fast, then Hannah slams the brakes. The cab slides to a halt. An Infected slams against Henry's window. At that moment, the back windscreen smashes. The hands of the Infected grab hold of Henry's head. Hannah watches, turned around in the seat. Henry scream - and we see it's Mailer's face behind him. Hannah floors the accelerator again, but this time in forward gear. Henry is sucked out of the back window.
","Middle cupboard.
Top cupboard. Another short, uncomfortable pause. Hannah looks at Jim and Selena from her position near the doorway. Her expression is blank and unreadable.
Or die here. Hannah speaks so rarely that her interjection seems to take everyone by surprise. Including her. For a moment she looks flustered, but then she continues.
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said. You need us just the same as we need you. We need each other. And we'll never be safe in the cities, and soldiers could keep us safe. She pauses for a breath.
So we have to try and get there.
Almost there! As Hannah puts an expert twist on the last wheel nut, the cab's back lights pick up the faces of the Infected spilling over the barricade.
But we don't know what's in there.
(taking a handful of
Yes, Dad. Frank, Jim, and Selena begin to walk towards the service station, holding their weapons at the ready.
(leaning out of the
It's true. They are like biscuits.
Do you think they're infected?
Can't sleep.
...Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.
Can I, Dad?
Da-ad, plee-ease. I can't sleep.
Is it snow?
I don't understand. Did they leave? Jim pushes open the flaps of another tent with his baseball bat.
Dad... are you okay? Frank turns. Hannah is there, with Jim. Selena stands a little way further back.
...What? Frank frowns. A hand goes to his temple.
...Dad?
(moving to Frank) Why? What's... Frank lashes out and shoves Hannah away, knocking her back to the ground.
No! No! Hannah lunges towards her dad, but is caught by Selena.
Dad!
...Dad? Selena lets Hannah go. Suddenly, the GUNFIRE comes again. Three shots in quick succession - into Frank's motionless body. In a daze, Hannah starts towards her dead father.
I don't want to eat. Henry picks up on their exchange.
