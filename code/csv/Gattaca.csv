txt,"--Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say? The Director smiles at the notion and places a computer disc on Jerome's desk.
(deadpan as he continues to urinate) Only every time I'm in here. Jerome hands the container to Lamara who seals and label it as Jerome refastens his trousers.
I'll tell you at the end of the week. Jerome departs.
He fell. Lucky it was only the second floor. The owner nods and returns to his magazine. When he looks up again one of his tripods is missing its telescope and Jerome is nowhere to be seen.
(guiltily closing the book) I have to know where you come from.
(referring to Eugene's medal, impressed) What about this?
(rueful) You had to be a right-hander.

(inspecting a hair follicle) Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home.
It's not too late to back out.
What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
(perplexed) What about the interview?
We're still going ahead as planned?
No bother.
Last night? I was at home. Irene makes a note with her stylus.
No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone. Irene makes another note.
(wry smile) Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about
Were
(teasing) So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why don't we say we were together?
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you? Irene contemplates the question.
(gently pressing) Well, shall we say we spent the evening together? Irene is still unsure whether or not Jerome is serious.
The Mission Director.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag. Eugene takes in the news, a smile broadening across his face.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
That's not the point.
(still tempering Eugene's enthusiasm) You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got my final physical tomorrow. Jerome wheels Eugene's chair to a specially constructed platform that allows the wheels to spin in mid-air. Jerome tapes an electrode to Eugene's chest and attaches the wire to a slim recording device. Eugene begins to spin the wheel of the chair faster and faster. Jerome monitors Eugene's steady heartbeat through a set of headphones.
Not as much as I'll miss your Stroganoff. I'd like to take one of your chefs with me.
Let's get out of here.
You drive.
Keep going!! Keep going!! Finally the car spins to a halt in a cloud of dust. When the dust settles it is revealed that they have been circling the base of a huge satellite dish in a desolate location.
(zipping his fly) And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
(looking at his watch) 11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.
A day or so.
You should be going instead of me. Jerome taps Eugene's lifeless legs with his foot.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
(attempting to comfort) It's okay, Eugene.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
It's all right.
(smiling to himself) You must be drunk to call me Vincent. But Eugene does not reply, drifting into sleep once again. Jerome pulls a blanket over him. On the verge of leaving, Jerome's attention is drawn to a wall on the far side of the room. Approaching the wall, near Eugene's mirrored closet, he detects a faint mechanical whir coming from inside the adjacent condominium. Jerome contemplates investigating but exits the condominium instead - climbing the spiral staircase to his own condominium.
Director, Napoleon's helping me today. The Director regards both men suspiciously.
(exiting to the testing lab) Don't worry about it.
(eyes fixed on the view) We were looking at each other. You stopped. Irene, also keeps her gaze ahead.
(shrugging as if it makes no difference to him) We were just looking.
(never taking his eyes from her) Sorry, the wind caught it. Irene meets his gaze. There is not a breath of wind. The hair lies, plainly visible on the ground.
(as if making conversation) Have they found our friend?
(shrugs) It was a mercy-killing after all.
Where?
Does it have a name?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
(collecting up sample bags from the work bench) We can't stay here.
They think I offed the Director. Eugene wheels himself over to Jerome, unconcerned.
They found my eyelash.
In a corridor.
(resuming his collection of samples) Come on--we're taking off.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. We should cut our losses.
They'll recognize me.
I'm sorry. (reluctant admission) I think I was crying. Eugene is uncomfortable at the notion.
You really had other offers?
Mind if I borrow a tie? EUGENE is more interested in the car parked outside the condominium. IRENE sits in a convertible Citroen DS, dressed in a classic but provocative black suit. Unaware that she is being observed she touches up her lipstick in the rearview mirror.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
(agreeing with the selection) Good choice. Jerome fumbles with the knot. From his chair, Eugene knots Jerome's tie for him. Jerome is intrigued that for once Eugene is abstaining - he has not touched his drink.
Not thirsty? (referring to the fridge) We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
Never stopped you before. (regarding Eugene's head) And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
(trying hard to convince) Yes...
Why would I be angry? It was beautiful. He quickly turns away to lead the applause. On stage, the pianist raises his hands to acknowledge the crowd. Both his hands contain a perfectly formed extra finger.
(conspiratorial) Better not. (nodding in Irene's direction) Don't want to give you a contaminated specimen...if you get my meaning. IRENE plays along, shrugging coyly at the cop. We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of Jerome's hand as he furtively retrieves a hair follicle attached to his shirt cuff. With the hair already in his fingers, he pretends to pluck a hair from his head, faking a wince at the appropriate moment. The cop, wearing transparent latex gloves, takes the follicle and places it in a receptacle in his kit. After a short moment the hair confirms JEROME's driving ID which appears on the kit's electronic screen. As the cop departs, Irene looks questioningly at Jerome.
Thanks. (answering her unasked question) You never know where those swabs have been. Irene nods, however clearly not convinced. She shakes the doubt from her mind.
Come on. We'll miss it.
You'll be next.
What exactly is wrong?
(still not quite recovered from his surprise) Of course.
Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.
(trying to be blas√à) You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.
(smiling back) I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander. Irene enters the craft.
It's not yor fault, Director. (afterthought) If your predecessor were still around we may not be going to Gaspra at all. That's what
(referring to the table lined with syringes) What's with the plungers, Lamar? What are you doing, opening a blood bank? The syringes are clearly not Lamar's idea.
Damn!! Having pulled away from Lamar's grasp, Jerome withdraws the bent needle himself, blood still squirting from his vein.
(unfazed, putting Lamar at his ease) You must be out of practise, Lamar. Lamar hurriedly takes the syringe from Jerome.
(regarding the squimish detective, as he holds the gauze to his arm) Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes. The Detective notices the spatter of blood across his brogues and, with a look of disdain, wipes it clean. He tosses the incriminating tissue down a hygenically sealed garbage shoot. Lamar places Jerome's labelled vial in the carousel where it is immediately analyzed by the computer. Jerome's ""legitimate"" Employee ID code appears on the screen -
(joking darkly) I guess somebody beat me to it.
(slightly guilty) I'm sorry. I've got plans.
(referring to his bandage) She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Michael's. Eugene looks at him askance.
Everybody goes there.
(afterthought as he picks up his jacket) Will you be okay?
(seeing through the bravado) We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, ""How are you?"" Forty-five minutes later I reply, ""Not bad. How are you?""
(wry smile, enjoying her fascination) You've never been here? (a dessert trolley is wheeled up) Let me order for you. Jerome selects a chocolate torte from the trolley. Jerome savors a spoonful. Irene is tempted but then remembers herself.
So sure of what you can't do. Do you even know what it tastes like, Irene? Irene goes to deny it but cannot. MICHAEL suddenly approaches the table with a WAITER in tow. Irene is about to steal a taste of the dessert with her finger when their plates and glasses are whisked away and the table immediately hoovered. Michael whispers in Jerome's ear.
(attempting to explain the hasty exit) Those checks take forever.
(grabbing her by the hand) Let's walk.
(holding his bruised knuckles) It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here. Jerome drags Irene across a vast, desolate lot, lit only by moonlight. Feeling exposed, he breaks into a run.
(anxious) Come on.
We'll get it later. (forcing her to look him in the eye) Irene, please. Irene realizes his seriousness. She begins to run with him. The clearing is wider than Jerome anticipated. They are only halfway across - extremely vulnerable if the Detective think yo look in their direction.
You just did. Irene looks back across the vast clearing they have just negotiated, realizing what she has just done. From across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing cry from the center FIGURE.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. (shrugs) Looked right instead of left.
But ""if it came to it"" then it couldn't have your-- (searching for an appropriate body part) --nose. (stroking her face) How perfect does your child have to be?
That's precisely what
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later. Jerome kisses her. Irene, also aware of the trucks, interrogates Jerome with her eyes.
We could go together one day. Irene considers the idea. She enters Gattaca alone.
(numb) How are you, Jerome?
How the hell did you get here.
(calling after her) Irene. Jerome goes to follow but Eugene stops him.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I'll see what I can do. The two men embrace, Caesar breaking off before Jerome.
(glancing to Caesar's locker) By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
(disturbingly calm) From Vincent. The two men face each other for the first time in a long time. The Investigator is transfixed by Jerome's face - scarcely able to believe his eyes.
(nodding to the Investigator's badge) Maybe it's
You almost sound like you believe that.
(refusing Anton's hand, glancing to the telescope above them) There are a few million miles to go yet.
(shaking his head) Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
(increasingly angered) God, even
(goading) Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible?
Who are you trying to convince?
Now is your chance to find out. Jerome swims away a second time. Anton is forced to follow once again. Angry now, gritting his teeth, Anton calls upon the same determination we have witnessed during his constant swimming in the pool. He puts on a spurt, slowly reeling in Jerome. Anton gradually draws alongside Jerome, certain that this effort will demoralize his older brother. But Jerome has been foxing - waiting for him to catch up. Jerome smiles at Anton. With almost a trace of sympathy, he forges ahead again. Anton is forced to go with him. They swim again for a long distance. It is Anton who gradually becomes demoralized - his strokes weaken, his will draining away. Anton pulls up, exhausted and fearful. Jerome also pulls up. However his face displays none of Anton's anxiety. They tread water several yards apart. The ocean is choppier now. The view of the lights on the shore is obscured by the peaks of the waves.
(calling back) Too late for that. We're closer to the other side. Anton looks towards the empty horizon.
(eerily calm) You wanted to know how I did it. That's how I did it, Anton. I never saved anything for the swim back. Anton stares at Jerome, aghast. The two men face each other in silence, treading water several yards apart in the dark, rolling ocean. Jerome turns and heads back towards the shore. Anton is left alone with the terrifying realization. The only sound, the wind and the water.
(wry smile, offering the hair to Irene) Here, take it. Irene takes the hair, the significance not lost on her.
(echoing Irene's words from their first encounter) If you're still interested, let me know. Irene contemplates the hair in her fingers for a moment, then deliberately lets it fall to the ground.
(awakening) A year is a long time.
(confused) Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples where I'm going.
(struggling to come to terms with the discovery) Why have you done this?
Where are you going?
Thank you.
(as he takes the plastic cup from Lamar) What's this, Lamar?
There's a problem, Lamar.
(as he urinates) Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
","(deadpan) Four foot six. Vincent grins, realizing that Eugene is referring to his seated height. There is an instant connection between the two men.
(apathetic, still under the influence of whatever he's been smoking) Six one.
(ironically referring to their mutual immobility) Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight? Vincent smiles.
I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be
(trying to be more diplomatic) Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You're both going to a lot of trouble-- (trying to be tactful) Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own. I'm sure you're sincere... (glancing to the space paraphenalia) ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself. Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it. My point is--how the hell do
(laughing) At least you're honest. (a thought occurs) Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.
Wrong color. It's silver. (tossing the bag of blood to Jerome) It's not easy living up to this. Eugene wheels away.
(wheeling by, looking over Jerome's shoulder at the signature) It needs work.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
(still grimacing, referring to the follicles) You really need that much?
(yanking out another hair) God, what
(marvelling at Jerome's earnestness) God, you're serious, aren't you? Jerome ignores him. Having learnt his lesson, he hands the envelopes to EUGENE to lick the flaps.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me. Are you sure
(referring to the bladder bag he wears) Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent. Jerome hurrise to the bathroom where, with some difficulty, he inserts his urine device for the first time. The new improved Jerome emerges into the living room ready for his interview.
You didn't forget the truffles? JEROME places the items in the refrigerator in the bathroom and retrieves a bottle of vodka - the vodka incongruous-looking beside the blood and urine specimens. Joining Eugene at his workbench, he pours them both a drink.
(sensing something amiss, trying to keep his humor) Who died?
(misinterpreting the deadpan remark) You wish.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community. So that's it. Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
(confused by Jerome's attitude) This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
So what? You didn't kill him, did you? Jerome shoots him a glance for the inappropriate remark.
(scoffing) Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the ""J. Edgars"" do find something, in a week-- (glancing up to the night sky) you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction. (gently chiding) Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
(smiling, a trace of bitterness) Honey, if you'd hurt me, I'd be cured. Eugene, the worse for drink, gropes for the waitress's leg but she easily avoids his clumsy pass.
You want to meet a real-life spaceman? Jerome, always aware, scanning the club, suddenly spies NAPOLEON, his Gattaca colleague, on the other side of the room. Napoleon is taking a hit from a vial concealed in his hand. Jerome abruptly turns his back to avoid being recognized.
(knocking back his drink, misinterpreting the hasty departure) You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
(screaming in both fear and exhilaration) I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!!
(gently chiding Jerome over the joyride) You idiot. You could ruin everything with a stunt like that. Eugene spies a spacecraft launching from Gattaca city.
(gazing up into the night sky) At least up there your piss will be worth something. (smiling at the thought) You'll all be showering in it, right?
(referring to the rocket ship) What
How long do you stay up there before you go?
(beaming) I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life. Eugene laughs to himself and passes the bottle to Jerome.
(glancing heavenwards, shaking his head) You know I'm scared of heights.
(sarcastically referring to the pool of vomit) I'm sorry. Did you want it? Jerome meets Eugene's gaze. There is a trace of bitterness in Eugene's drunken smile.
Let me get it for you. Eugene bends down to scoop up some vomit with his hand but the elevator arrives and Jerome quickly wheels him away. Eugene's head flops to the side as he passes out.
(maudlin, sobbing like a child) I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
--I walked right in front of it. I was never more sober in my life. Jerome looks at Eugene's lifeless legs, trying to cover his shock at the revelation.
(grabbing Jerome by the collar) I'm proud of you, Vincent. Eugene's head falls back onto the pillow.
(into phone) --I know what I ordered. I ordered ""Honey Dawn"" and you sent me ""Summer Wheat"". JEROME descends the staircase, taking the steps two at a time. He immediately goes to the refrigerator, removing trays of samples. Eugene abruptly hangs up the phone.
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
What makes them think that?
(a flicker of anxiety) Where?
(blas√à once again) Could be worse. They could have found it in your eye. Jerome half-smiles despite the situation.
I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
(angrily grabbing a tray from Jerome's hands) Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash to you. They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
(scoffing) How could they recognize you? (referring to the torn photo of 20-year-old Vincent on the wall)
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless?
Well save those tears. Jerome shrugs awkwardly and pours them both a drink.
(shrugs) I'm sure I could have.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
(skeptical) Is that all?
If you say so. (referring to the ties in Jerome's hand) The stripe.
I don't feel too good. I think I'm still drunk from last night.
If I were you I'd worry about myself. (nodding to Jerome's spectacles) Haven't you forgotten something? Jerome pockets the spectacles and enters the bathroom for his contact lenses. The horn sounds outside the window a second time and Jerome hastily exits. We stay with Eugene. Irene catches a glimpse of him before he moves away from the window. Jerome emerges from the building. As the couple drive away, Eugene wheels himself to the full length mirror. He regards his own reflection for a moment and opens the mirror - a disguised door opening into the adjacent apartment. A cloud of condensed water vapor billows out. GERMAN, the DNA Broker, emerges with an ENGINEER. He sends the engineer on his way and joins Eugene at his desk. Eugene hands German a credit card that he wipes through his computer.
(looking away) You got it, German.
How was your evening?
(teasing) You
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
(adamant) She doesn't
Where are we going?
(feigning hurt) Again?
I'm sure you'll be very convincing. Jerome ignores the remark.
Where are you taking her?
(incredulous, glancing around the room) You may as well invite her here.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
How long?
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Hello?
(nonchalant) I was never very good at it, remember?
Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.
Where's my kiss? The Investigator scrutinizes Irene's reaction. With only the merest hesitation she takes her cue from Eugene and kisses him affectionately on the forehead. She perches herself on the arm of the sofa. Eugene takes the opportunity to rest his arm on her leg.
Now
(feigning boredom) Again? The Investigator slowly circles Eugene, regarding him with the utmost scrutiny. He compares his face to the doctored Gattaca ID photo - a passable likeness. Eugene bends towards the bowl and dry retches.
Forgive me for not getting up. Irene puts a comforting hand on Eugene's shoulder.
(reassuring to Irene, referring to the blood flowing into the syringe) It's okay. Maybe they can find out what I've got. Under the Investigator's watchful eye, Detective Hugo withdraws the syringe and immediately inserts a small amount of the blood into the portable analyzer he wears. Naturally, it confirms that Eugene is Jerome. Irene does her best to conceal her shock. Hiding his frustration, the Investigator distractedly tours the room while Hugo packs up his gear. The Investigator idly toys with the telescope pointed out of the window. Next he wanders towards the closet and reaches for the doorknob.
As long as you don't do it in my closet. (nodding to the other side of the room) Over there.
Clean the whole house if you want.
Not bad, Jerome.
(deadpan) I could always walk. I've been faking it. Jerome almost laughs, despite the situation. Only now does he notice Irene on the other side of the room, her mind racing. She looks at Jerome and Eugene together and runs from the apartment.
(referring to the incinerator) That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
(unconcerned) He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes. Eugene idly inspects one of the blood sachets.
Don't be deceived, Irene. These are just the clothes. He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
(sympathetic smile) You have more in common than you know. Irene's hand involuntarily goes to her heart.
But they say
I have your samples ready.
(meeting Jerome's gaze) No, but you might need them when you get back. Eugene wheels across the room and opens the mirrored door. The water vapor billows out. Jerome regards Eugene. Eugene leads Jerome inside for the first time. Inside are two rows of four identical, industrial refrigerators. They contain thousands of blood and urine specimens. Jerome regards them with awe and more than a little unease.
Everything you need to last you two lifetimes. EUGENE points out an extra specimen of semen in the first refrigerator.
There's an extra specimen. I wish I could give it to her myself. (afterthought) But then, you always were better at being me. Eugene leads the way out of the refrigerator room.
(as he seals the mirrored door) In case you get back before I do.
(glancing to the suitcases) I'm travelling too. Jerome goes to question Eugene's travel plans but thinks better of it. He kneels before his friend and embraces him.
I got the better end of the deal. I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream. Jerome smiles and hugs Eugene a final time. Eugene stuffs an envelope into Jerome's pocket.
(referring to the note, glancing heavenwards) Not until you're upstairs. Jerome exits. Eugene watches him go.
","Excuse me, Jerome. I'm sorry to bother you. Jerome turns, not displeased by the interruption.
(referring to her notepad) I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
I was at home.
(hesitant) Yes.
(wary, wondering where the conversation is headed) No.
(confused) Why would we do that?
To be convincing, Jerome, I would have to know what that was like. Irene turns and departs. Jerome watches her go.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.
I know about you. Jerome turns to her, startled, trying to read her face. Irene takes a deep breath and abruptly plucks a long, dark hair from her head.
(offering the hair to Jerome) Here, take it. Jerome, confused, takes the hair - more in reflex than intent.
(a challenge) If you're still interested, let me know. Jerome contemplates the hair in his fingers for a moment, then deliberately lets it fall to the grounf.
Friend?
They found an eyelash.
In the South Wing.
Just some In-Valid. Vincent-- (trying to come up with the last name) --somebody. Jerome turns away to disguise his alarm. He quickly recovers.
(a smile playing around her lips) You celebrate, Jerome?
(catching his look of astonishment) You didn't know?
(picking up a resentment, confused) You're angry--
I want to show you something. She accelerates away. We see the road ahead from Jerome's POV. Without his contact lenses, it is a blur.
(calling back urgently from the other side, mindful of the light beginning to leak into the sky) Come on! We'll miss it! Irene stares expectantly back at Jerome with her 20/20 vision, unaware of his predicament. Jerome puts a foot off the curb at the wrong moment and is almost collected by an on-coming car. Irene is taken-aback at his mistiming. Does she detect a squint on Jerome's face? To Jerome, the figure of Irene on the other side of the highway is merely a featureless shape but he feels her expectation. He touches the spectacles, still in his pocket, but they are an unthinkable option. He shakes the idea from his head and turns back to the swiftly- flowing highway. He makes up his mind - he cannot allow himself to be shamed, even at the risk of life and limb. Hardly even glancing at the traffic, he suddenly bolts blindly across the road. Headlights hurtling towards him, cars fortuitously brushing past his heels, horns blaring. Jerome makes a final leap to the haven of the far curb, the rush of air from a large, fast-moving truck blowing him the final inches to the sidewalk. Irene is stunned by the near miss. She is about to comment but Jerome takes her by the arm and ushers her towards the dunes.
What did I tell you? Jerome nods. However, to his eyes the rising yolk is nothing but an out-of-focus, abstract ink blot.
I envy you, Jerome.
I don't think so. The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun-- (letting a handful of sand slip through her fingers) --on this satellite right here. Irene turns to Jerome.
(blurting out what's really on her mind) --Listen, I don't want to waste your time and I
(enjoying his unease) It's here. My heart. (adding quickly) I'm careful--weekly check-ups. I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet-- (slowly removing his hand) I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Nothing yet. I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties. (matter-of-fact) But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67. Jerome's mouth drops a little, betraying his surprise at the statement from a woman plainly still in her twenties.
Of course I think about it every day.
Excuse me, Mr Morrow. The investigators have begun their testing.
I'm afraid not.
So you didn't do it after all.
What
I'd better not. She reaches for her elegant pill box. Jerome takes another spoonful.
Why are we leaving?
(stunned) Jerome! Spying other Detectives some distance away in the parking lot. Jerome leads Irene out of a hidden side gate.
What about the car?
Who are they?
I can't.
My medication. I left it back there.
(upset, a strangled protest) Are you trying to kill me? Are you?! Don't you understand, I can't do that! Jerome tenderly removes Irene's hand from her pulse.
So sure of what you can't do. Jerome follows her inside.
(referring to the shins) What happened?
(comforted by the thought) So you're not so smart after all. (awkward about raising the subject) I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank. In fact, I'd
(mildly irritated by what she perceives as his mocking) You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--
What is it?
I'll miss you. Jerome is still focussed on the entranceway.
(looking skywards) --when you go away.
(picking up a phone) I'll call and let him know. The Investigator gently but firmly removes the phone from Irene's hand and replaces the receiver in the cradle.
(a moment's hesitation) Jerome--?
Good to see you're feeling better.
It's about the Director.
(to the Investigator) Couldn't we do this another time?
(taking Eugene's lead) Actually, the kitchen needs doing. The Investigator switches on the mini-vac to take a specimen from the floor, then promptly kills the machine. Looking down, the Investigator notices the trail of Eugene's perspiration on the highly polished floor leading to the spiral staircase. Eugene, reading the Investigator's mind, goes to call out but the words remain frozen on his tongue. Hugo follows his superior as they start to descend the stairs. Irene and Eugene are left staring at one another.
Hello. No reply. Irene hesitantly ventures further, drawn to the spiral staircase. She tentatively makes her way down the stairs and into Eugene's dimly lit condominium. With wonder and reverence, she examines the instruments and samples laid out on Eugene's work benches. She opens the refrigerator in the bathroom and inspects the samples and sachets. Finally she regards the empty incinerator.
I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
(never taking her eyes from him, echoing Jerome's words from their first encounter) Sorry, the wind caught it. Once again there is not a breath of wind. The hair lies, plainly visible on the edge of the pool. From an upstairs window, EUGENE observes the couple.
Not so long--just once around the sun. Jerome smiles. For once Irene seems to be looking forward to the trip. She exits the room.
","(to the tongue, as he inserts the tip of the swab into an analyzer) Let's see what you've got to say for yourself. A FEMALE ASSISTANT, looking on, hardly has time to smile at the remark before information begins to appear on a nearby computer terminal. The computer gradually builds a portrait of the owner of the tongue using genetic predictors. The Investigator wanders over to the window as his Assistant reads the information from the screen.
(interest piqued)
(shrugs) Someone who is mindful that the blind still speak. The INVESTIGATOR is alerted by the chime of his nearby computer. On the screen, he discovers the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT and the accompanying flashing message:
(gently rebuking his subordinate) A man's dead, Detective.
Grudges?
(shaking his head adamantly, referring to the bag in his hand) No,
--What
(terse) So there's a 20 percent chance he's
No. Not
(glancing to the profile in Hugo's hand) Who knows with these ""deficients""? His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--I've already run it. There's no record of any living relative.
(irritated, glancing to the sample bag) Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found. All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself. We focus on JEROME at his work station. Although he continues to work, he clrarly feels the presence of the INVESTIGATORS on the mezzanine floor behind him. A MEDICAL DIRECTOR approaches the programmer in the neighboring work station - NAPOLEON, the programmer Jerome encountered in the nightclub the previous evening.
How often do you test, Director?
(intrigued) Surely you know what you have.
We believe we have a suspect.
(referring to the profile of VINCENT on Hugo's computer notepad) This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor. In the room below, Jerome nonchalantly steps off the treadmill, stealthily retrieves the recording device from beneath the control panel and returns it to his cigarette pack. He casually wipes off drops of sweat from the machine with a towel, briefly glances to Irene with the Investigators and exits to the locker room. The Director idly regards the image of VINCENT on Hugo's handheld screen. He does not recognize the face.
We're in the wrong place. We're wasting time.
--There's that word again. I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective. Not exactly a slave to probability. Is it ""likely"" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies. Do you need any more than that?
I don't like anybody
This is a murder investigation. The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
(gently stroking her hair) You are so beautiful, are you sure you
(a cruel edge to his voice) You have so much wrong with you, you'll be lucky to see next year. He roughly forces himself on top of her but she remains defiant.
(parting her legs) I'm not paying you to talk.
A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
(taking a perverse pleasure in the slowly dawning revelation) Of course. He's a ""de-gene-erate"". (glancing to a photo of the Gattaca crime scene) He works at Gattaca. Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom? Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
(mind racing) He was afraid of being exposed. That's why he did it.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
(smiling to himself) A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you. (pause) Intravenous. Hugo's mouth drops open at the mention of ""intravenous"".
(shaking his head) Blood. From the vein. The Investigator turns on his heel to prevent further protest. The Detective and his ASSISTANTS exchange looks of exasperation behind the Investigator's back.
Something's not right.
(resolute) No, we've missed something. We Hoover again.
Get it. From outside, if you have to.
(angered by Hugo's excuses) I'll take it out of your damn
Thank you, no.
(unfazed) You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
(surveying the mostly empty facility) No, but since there aren't too many
(to Josef, referring to the telescope) You see, Director, I prefer my microscope.
(an accusing tone) You run a clean establishment.
(showing Vincent's mugshot) Do you recognize this man?
I bet. Hugo calls out from the side door where he has discovered his fallen colleague.
(to the still dazed Detective, examining his injuries) Did he hit you with his fist?
(reprimanding the beaten Detective) Don't touch your face. Don't swallow. Don't spit. (to Hugo) Quick, clean his teeth. Hugo uses a flashlight and a small dental-like implement to try to pick skin from Jerome's knuckles from between the Detective's teeth. The Investigator finds the hidden side door.
(to Hugo, covering his frustration) What are you waiting for?
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
(shrugs, ambivalent) Why not?
You worried about the cost?
(regarding Hugo with a condescending smile) They said the same thing about myopia and obesity. You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful? Maybe they'd be
So we have two choices. Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or... (looking out over the empty complex) ...he
This time I will supervise each test personally.
At least it's nothing contagious.
Let's not spoil the surprise. (to Irene) I understand you can show us the way. The anxious Director Josef calls out to protest one further time but the Investigator is on his way out of the door.
(taunting) You don't know who he is, do you, Irene? He hands her the pill box found in Michael's.
You think you have problems?
I don't believe so. Detective Hugo takes a seat in the chair beside the sofa and unpacks a syringe from the kit he carries.
Mind if I take a leak?
(to Eugene, referring to ther mini-vac) May I?
(gazing at the Director, struggling to come to grips with the turn of events) This can't be him. The Detective regards his superior incredulously, intrigued that he could still cling so stubbornly to his theory in the face of such overwhelming evidence.
(a trace of desperation, grasping at straws) Luca could still be an accomplice. The Investigator turns away, unwilling or unable to accept the explanation. Hugo regards the Investigator with a trace of sympathy. He furtively retrieves the Investigator's tissue from the trash.
(excited) Hugo! I've found him!
(not listening, referring to his discovery) A fingerprint. There's something to be said for nostalgia. (realizing what Hugo has said) What did you find? Hugo puts a specimen bag on the counter. It contains the Investigator's discarded tissue. The Investigator does not recognize it.
(interest piqued) Where did you get this? The Investigator immediately deposits the tissue into an analyzer.
Vincent-- Jerome is stopped in his tracks by the sound of his given name and the voice that calls it. He makes no further attempt to flee but turns to face his pursuer. The Investigator steps out of the shadows.
Vincent, what are you running from?
Has it been so long, you don't remember who I am?
","You're standing on Venus. Anton lifts his foot. There is a bead beneath it.
--I don't care. I'll take the risk.
Why didn't
(confused) What do you mean?
But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier for you to see me when I'm on the other side of it. Caesar smiles at Vincent's cockiness.
What do you think?
(staring through his glasses) German, is that you?
I hope he's not just a body.
How do I square the accident?
(looking around for a likely candidate but finding none) Where is he? German reaches towards a PARAPLEGIC sitting in his wheelchair in the stairwell directly in front of them, his head slumped, an incriminating bong nestled in his lap. German pulls the man's head up by the hair. EUGENE. Depsite the patchy, unkempt beard and thick glaze over his eyes he bears a striking similarity to Vincent. Vincent holds a mirror beside the face of the lethargic Eugene to compare his own reflection.
(still not fully convinced) That's the hair color in his profile? German checks an entry in his computer:
(touching his own dark strands) I'd have to bleach my hair.
(a thought occurs, addressing the paraplegic for the first time) How tall are you?
Okay, how tall did you
(to German, disappointed) He's too tall.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
You okay, Jerome?
What's wrong with it?
(shrugs) Suit yourself.
German.
(shrugs and states it simply) I don't know exactly, Jerome.
