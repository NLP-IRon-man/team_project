FINAL DRAFT | June 3, 2008
 | The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.
 | The Boss punches the table.
 | He swallows.
 | ONLOOKERS swoon.
 | ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.
 | The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky. Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
 | The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final blow while doing a split between two trees.
 | The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god- rays shine down upon him.
 | As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain into the sea of bandits.
 | In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.
 | We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs, and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green sword).
 | Po SIGHS.
 | He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly is too worthy a foe.
PO | Uh, nothing!
 | Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
 | OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and then quickly ducks out of sight.
 | He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the wall. It bounces off.
 | He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of the way.
 | Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work, which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a panda his size.
 | He gets back to work.
PO'S DAD | About what?
 | Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his throwing star behind his back.
 | THOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables.
 | Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his throwing star is sitting in it.
 | He throws his arms around Po.
 | When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle apron.
 | Po looks surprised.
 | Dad gets a wistful look in his eyes.
PO | I know. Is here.
 | He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.
 | A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the distant JADE PALACE.
 | End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle between the Palace buildings.
 | Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark shapes move in the foreground.
 | Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
 | Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously, diving on Shifu.
 | Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers go flying -
 | They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
 | He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
 | Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is mentioned.
SHIFU | Crane - height. Viper - subtlety. Mantis--
 | Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
 | Shifu looks up, concerned.
 | He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
 | Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
 | Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
 | Shifu looks stricken.
 | Shifu makes a split decision.
 | He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
 | The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from Shifu.
OOGWAY | One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
 | Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
 | Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.
 | Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
 | A couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a palace pig hits a tiny gong. This gets Po's attention. He rushes up to the poster.
 | Customers jump up excitedly.
 | Po urges the villagers out the restaurant.
 | Customers rush to finish their food.
 | Other customers are finishing their soup.
 | One old lady customer slowly counts out coins and puts them on the table.
 | He starts to run.
 | Po stops dead in his tracks, busted.
PO'S DAD | But you're forgetting your noodle cart! The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
 | Po wants to say something to his dad, but he loses his nerve.
 | Where's Po?
 | PAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the daunting task before him.
 | Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.
 | He stops, flopping onto his back to catch his breath.
 | WIDEN TO REVEAL he's only made it up seven steps.
 | Two Pigs pass by.
 | Po watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This is his heroic moment.
 | Po tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the stairs.
SHIFU | Yes, Master Oogway.
 | As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.
 | The doors to the palace arena begin to close.
 | Po runs to the entrance and proceeds to bang on the door.
 | DRUMS inside drown out Po's pounding. He yells.
 | Inside, spectators' screams drown out Po's yelling.
 | Po panics for a beat and then finds a window. He jumps and weakly struggles to pull himself up.
 | Po struggles to peek through the window.
SHIFU | Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It is my great honor to present to you... Tigress! Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!
 | The Five jump into the middle of the ring.
 | Po manages a brief glimpse of the Five before a gust of wind knocks Po to the ground and shuts the window.
 | Po runs over to a crack in the wall.
 | Inside the arena, Po catches a glimpse of Crane as he spreads his wings.
 | One of the spectators walks in front of Po, cutting off his view.
 | Po backs up to get a better look at Crane in the sky and accidentally falls down the stairs.
 | Po climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it.
 | Po tries karate chopping the door open...to no avail. He slumps to the ground.
PO | Ow...
 | Po attempts a pole vault, but falls on his back. The pole whips around and hits him into the arena wall.
 | Po rigs a catapult, only to get clobbered by it. The crowd
 | Po snaps to attention.
 | Po pulls on a rope tied to a tree.
SHIFU (O.S.) | Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death!
 | Tigress sets up to deliver her move.
 | Po launches himself up above the fence, gets a peek at Tigress, then falls out of view just as she does her move.
 | Po lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent.
 | Shifu motions for the Five to gather in the center of the ring.
 | He sees the fireworks and has an idea.
 | Po's Dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse.
 | Po looks uneasy.
 | He looks at the fuse... almost all gone... Po holds onto the chair for dear life, closes his eyes, and braces himself for liftoff.
 | He's still on the ground. The fuse was a dud. Po falls face first into the dirt. He looks away, embarrassed. Po's Dad holds out his apron.
 | Po sighs, starts to reach for the apron, then-- BOOM! The rockets ignite, propelling Po into the stadium wall.
 | Po's rocket chair blasts him into the sky amid a shower of fireworks.
 | Po climbs up and up...until the rockets die out and the chair loses power...
 | Oogway's arm sweeps down the line of the expectant Five... Po falls towards the center of the ring...
 | The tension builds as the Five wait to see who will be picked. Then... SMASH!
 | Po lands and kicks up a huge dirt cloud, obscuring the ring.
 | He looks up. An awful realization starts to dawn. Po GULPS. He is desperately embarrassed.
PO | Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
 | He tries to shuffle his butt out of there, mumbling apologies.
 | Po tries moving out of the way of Oogway's finger, but it keeps following him.
 | Oogway grabs Po's hand and holds it up for all to see.
 | The crowd goes wild! They cheer! They scream! Confetti falls! A palanquin is carried past Shifu.
SHIFU | Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?
 | Po stands there, utterly stunned, his mouth hanging open. He is abruptly lifted up out of shot.
 | Cut to the Palace Geese straining.
 | Po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. He is carried off. Shifu elbows his way urgently through the thronging crowd to get to Oogway.
 | Oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen CRASH!
 | The camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed under Po.
 | Shifu looks at Oogway. Oogway just smiles.
 | A squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin, and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the Jade Palace. Stunned, Shifu watches them go.
 | Behind him, the Five approach and bow.
 | Shifu spins around.
 | Confetti flutters through the air as the celebration continues around them.
 | Zeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry spots him in the distance. He lands, sliding on the ice and crashing into the gate. The rhinos point their spears at him.
 | CLANG! The doors creak open. The terrified goose peers in.
COMMANDER | What?!?! (reading) "Double the guard?! Extra precautions?! Your prison may not be adequate!"
 | The Goose is quaking in fear. Stern Rhinos surround him, staring daggers at him. The Commander snaps the scroll shut.
COMMANDER | Escape from Chogun Prison is impossible!
 | The Goose is awed by the cavernous prison.
ZENG | Whoa.
 | The goose looks over the bridge's edge. The prison goes down a long ways. The commander hits the goose on the back.
 | A feather from the goose drifts down the prison.
COMMANDER | Take us down.
 | Several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down. The commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying to scare the goose.
 | The commander just laughs. The elevator finally lands, sending an echo throughout the prison.
 | A number of doors unlock, one after the other. Finally, a drawbridge is lowered out onto an island.
COMMANDER | It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe.
 | He shoves the goose out ahead of him.
 | They approach TAI LUNG, a giant, muscular snow leopard bound in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains. He barely registers signs of life. The commander walks right up to him.
 | The goose can't believe it.
 | The Commander stomps on Tai Lung's tail. We hear a crunch. The goose flinches. But Tai Lung does not react.
 | Tai Lung doesn't move. His eyes stare coldly straight ahead.
ZENG | Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we please go now?
 | The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose hurries after him.
 | The goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung.
 | HIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail.
 | Po is ushered in and the doors close. He is alone. He runs back to the closed palace doors.
 | Po finally realizes where he is.
 | He rushes up to a display of armor.
(GASP) | Master Flying Rhino's Armor! With authentic battle damage!
 | He rushes up to a green sword, making sure not to touch it.
(GASP) | The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking-- OW!
 | He stares at a black sopt on the wall.
 | He admires a painting.
(GASP) | I've only seen paintings of that painting...
 | Po runs around the room, amazed by all the ancient kung fu artifacts. Something special catches Po's eye.
 | He runs over to it.
 | Po GASPS.
 | Po turns and sees Shifu.
PO | Hey, how's it going?
 | Po turns back to the vase.
 | Po bumps the vase which falls and BREAKS.
 | The vase debris screams as Po tries to pick up the pieces.
 | Po fumbles around. Shifu looks irked.
 | Shifu smiles and shakes his head.
 | He points to a dragon on the ceiling with a single scroll in its mouth.
PO | No, I...
 | Shifu walks around Po - pointing out his weaknesses.
 | Shifu HITS Po on the butt with his staff.
 | Shifu SWATS Po on the arm with his staff.
 | Shifu HITS Po in the belly with his staff.
 | Shifu pinches Po's outstretched digit.
PO | (gasp) The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!
 | Po nervously eyes his finger locked in Shifu's grip and nods quickly.
 | He gestures to the gauntlet. Po's eyes go wide.
 | Shifu walks away and Po half-heartedly follows.
 | Po points at a rather friendly-looking dummy.
 | Relieved, Po turns to the dummy. The Five gather around him.
PO | Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures -- except for you, Mantis. You're about the same.
 | Mantis gives him a look.
 | Po psyches himself up, doing some Jack Fu.
 | Shifu and the Five stare at Po, perplexed.
 | Po lightly hits the dummy and it rocks back into place.
SHIFU | Why don't you try again? A little harder...
 | Po punches it again, knocking it all the way backwards. He turns to Shifu, smug.
 | WHAP! The dummy rights itself and smacks Po. Totally dazed, Po trips and stumbles his way through the obstacle course. The Five instinctively step forward to help Po, but Shifu holds up his hand to stop them.
PO | Ow, that hurts.
 | A spiky tethered ball sends Po flying into the jade turtle exercise, where it rattles him around.
 | Back to Po in the turtle bowl.
 | The turtle spills him out and he stumbles into the army of wooden dummies.
 | He struggles to get on his feet, takes one step and reaches out to a dummy arm...and immediately gets pummeled all over again. Po comes out the other side battered and bruised and finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of flame. We see reflections of fire on the Five and Shifu as Po gets singed. He comes crawling into frame.
PO | How did I do?
 | As the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing everything.
 | He attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut. He lifts up his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls over.
 | He tip-toes into the hall.
 | SQUEAK. The floorboards strain beneath him. SQUEAK.
 | Po takes a gentle step. CRE-E-E-A-AA--CHUNK! Po's foot goes through the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK! THUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom door.
 | Crane is staring back at him.
 | Crane looks at his wing.
CRANE | Oop.
 | Po does a spastic series of Kung Fu moves. We hear a RIP, and reveal that he's kicked his foot through the paper wall.
 | Po looks stung to be hearing this from one of his heroes.
 | Crane stops Po before he embarrasses himself even more.
 | Po is mortified, but covers.
 | Po shuts the door. Crane sighs. The door flies open. Po enters with an eager smile.
CRANE | I didn't say anything.
 | Po backs out into the hall and closes the door.
 | Po turns and walks down the hall to find a vacant room. CREAK-
 | She closes the door on Po, who slumps sadly.
 | Po spins around, his face dripping with peach juice.
PO | (mouth full) Is that what this is? I am so sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
 | Po sighs, there's no use trying to lie to Oogway.
 | Po looks confused.
OOGWAY | You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There is a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.
 | Oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a peach falls into Po's open hand.
 | An ALARM RINGS OUT!
 | The Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him.
 | The Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom of the pit.
 | Tai Lung struggles with his shackles.
 | Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls, creating a makeshift staircase.
 | The Commander shuts the Goose up.
 | Leaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as the volley of arrows flies down past him.
 | The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to the bottom of the pit.
 | Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and catches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the next tier, disappearing into the shadows.
 | Tai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the Rhino army await.
 | The Commander hushes the Goose.
 | Archers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump towards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and sparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs maniacally.
 | On his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning down to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.
 | Grabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it ahead of him at the guards.
COMMANDER | Yes.
 | WHUMP. The Goose hits the ground. The commander's horn prosthetic falls in front of him.
 | Tai Lung picks up the Goose by the throat.
TAI LUNG | I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I had been forgotten.
 | With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's ruffled feathers.
 | Tai Lung throws the Goose into the air and he flutters off. Lightning strikes.
 | One door remains closed.
SHIFU | Panda! Panda, wake up!
 | He slides open Po's door. The room is empty.
 | Reveal Po is in the middle of the floor, his legs spread wide apart. Po looks back over his shoulder to see Shifu and the Five enter the hall.
 | Crane approaches Po.
CRANE | Oh dear.
 | Crane gingerly grabs Po's waistband and attempts to pull him up by flapping his wings.
 | Crane pulls him up and Po flops onto his back.
SHIFU | You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat.
 | Shifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress leaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck. As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around Po, knocking him on the head.
 | Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu notices and steps forward.
 | He laughs excitedly and salutes Shifu.
 | Viper lashes her tail around Po's wrist, wrenches his arm back, flings him into the air and brings him crashing back down on his head.
 | Shifu snaps.
 | Monkey twirls a bamboo staff. He lunges at Po who takes a comical beating.
 | Shifu snaps.
 | Po and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. CRASH. Po falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup.
 | Shifu snaps.
 | We see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be... Mantis.
 | Shifu smiles. Flat on his back, Po manages a salute. Shifu has had it.
 | Po looks excited.
 | Po doesn't even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him.
 | Shifu whips Po around again.
 | Again, this time Shifu holds Po by the nose.
 | Po is totally inspired.
 | At his breaking point, Shifu flings Po into the air and then leaps at him with a flying kick.
 | The Five watch him fall.
VIPER | He's not gonna quit, is he?
 | Cut WIDE as Po continues to tumble.
 | Mantis pops up from behind Po holding a handful of needles and sticks Po again.
 | Po looks for Mantis...
 | ...But Mantis is now on his other shoulder. He jabs another needle into Po.
VIPER | Maybe you should take a look at this again.
 | Viper is holding a diagram of acupuncture meridians (onto which someone has overlaid a drawing of a panda.)
 | Quick cuts to Monkey meditating in his room and Crane doing calligraphy in his. Po's yelps distract them.
 | Po chuckles. The others look at each other and chuckle awkwardly.
 | He violently jabs another needle in Po.
 | Cut to Tigress out in the hallway. She can hear them talking.
 | Crane's shadow is silhouetted on the wall.
 | Tigress turns to Po.
 | Tigress approaches Po and leans in towards him.
 | Tigress shakes her head at the panda's ignorance.
 | Baby Tai Lung pulls on Shifu's whiskers.
TIGRESS (V.O.) | ...and when the boy showed talent in Kung Fu...
 | Baby Tai Lung punches the training dummy across the floor.
 | Shifu teaches Baby Tai Lung how to punch.
 | Hard cut to a full-grown Tai Lung demolishing a training dummy.
 | Tai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace. He crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu and Oogway.
 | Shifu leaps at Tai Lung to deliver a kick.
 | Seeing only baby Tai Lung running towards him, Shifu pulls his kick short. Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.
 | Tai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with strikes at his pressure points. He falls to the ground in a heap.
 | Young Tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the same manner as Tai Lung. Shifu corrects her form. Nothing more. Young Tigress looks crestfallen.
TIGRESS (V.O.) | ...or since.
 | The sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress.
 | Po makes a googly-eyed face.
 | Mantis pops up and halts Tigress.
 | Po falls face first to the floor, revealing his back is covered with needles.
 | He finally opens one eye.
 | BOOM. Zeng drops in from the ceiling.
 | He turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised.
 | Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.
 | A peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.
 | Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed in it.
OOGWAY | Ah, yes. But no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple, or an orange... but you will get a peach.
 | Oogway covers the seed with dirt.
 | Oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to Shifu.
 | He hands his staff to a confused Shifu.
 | Oogway backs away into the swirling fog.
 | The petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.
 | Oogway is gone.
 | We pan across to the bunkhouse.
 | Po flips some bowls and expertly lines them up on his arm. He ladles soup into them.
 | Po looks around expectantly and the Five (minus Tigress) dig in.
 | The others laugh. But not Tigress.
 | Tigress looks up from her meal.
 | On the others for a beat. Then Po shrugs.
 | Po laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face -- it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers.
 | The rest start laughing. Po realizes he's wearing a noodle moustache. He plays it up.
PO | (imitating Shifu) You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth!
 | The Five LAUGH.
 | The Five keep LAUGHING. Po reaches over and grabs two empty bowls and holds them up like ears.
 | As the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to smell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks up and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing.
 | Reveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's staff.
 | Po looks at the stone-faced Five. Tigress jumps to her feet.
 | He finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn. Embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a bra.
 | Po slurps up the noodle moustache. Monkey can't help but snicker.
SHIFU | You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children!
 | The bowls fall off. A beat as this sinks in... then Po starts to laugh.
 | Shifu just stares at him, deadly serious.
 | They notice Shifu holding Oogway's staff. They know what this means. They are saddened by the news.
 | He dramatically points at Po... but Po is gone.
SHIFU | Where'd he go?
 | Shifu throws up his hands in frustration and heads after Po.
 | He tries to maneuver around Shifu, but is redirected back.
 | He pushes Po back with the staff.
 | Shifu pokes him again, this time causing Po to fall on his back.
 | Po shoves the staff away and gets up.
SHIFU | Then why didn't you quit? You knew I was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed.
 | Po looks down at the Valley, then turns back to Shifu.
 | In frustration, Shifu yells out the answer.
 | Shifu walks away, leaving the path open to Po.
 | She flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in the valley below. She looks back up at the palace.
 | She takes off running.
 | The other four are right behind her.
 | She keeps going and they give chase.
 | The chase continues through the village.
 | Then...the others join her. Tigress smiles. They leap off into the night.
 | Entering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face with food. Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch.
 | In silence they eye each other. Shifu surveys the room -- broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches.
 | Shifu gets a glimmer in his eye. He has an idea.
 | Shifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway, waiting to see if his hunch is correct.
 | KLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his mouth. Po notices Shifu walking back in.
 | He glances back down at Shifu, whose disbelief turns to a wise smile.
 | He looks at the cookie and then can't help but eat it.
SHIFU | And yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split.
 | He and Po stare at each other for a beat. Then... WHOOMP! Po slips and crashes to the kitchen floor. A cookie rolls over to Shifu. He picks it up.
 | Shifu just continues walking.
 | Po sets his gear down and looks around. Shifu breathes in the morning mist as Po approaches.
 | Po begins to pat his armpits with water.
 | Po quickly stops. Realizing.
PO | (in awe) The pool of...
 | The camera cranes up to reveal they are standing on rock shapes that resemble a yin yang symbol.
 | As the camera pulls further out, it pulls back through a vision of Oogway doing Kung Fu moves.
 | FLASH FRAME -- Shifu leaps atop one of the rocks and looks down at Po.
 | Tears of joy well up in Po's eyes.
 | Po sniffs the tears back and smiles.
 | Po scowls.
SHIFU | But perhaps that is my fault. I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you is with this!
 | Shifu produces a bowl of dumplings.
 | Po stops short, suspicious.
 | Po grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks.
 | Po raises the dumpling to his mouth. WHOOSH! Shifu snatches the dumpling away and eats it himself.
SHIFU | I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
 | Po reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks the dumpling into the air.
 | Shifu eats it and Po scowls.
 | Po and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one left.
 | Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with his bamboo staff.
 | But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final dumpling.
 | Shifu smiles. Po has passed the final test.
 | But then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand.
 | Master and pupil bow to each other.
 | The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
 | Tai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.
 | The Five exchange quick, worried looks.
 | The Five exchange quick, confused looks.
 | Tigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
 | ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the rope by himself.
 | Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single strand of rope.
 | Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.
 | Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist. Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies safely to the mountain.
 | The Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...
 | Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.
 | With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.
 | Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.
 | He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
 | Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.
 | After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -
 | And he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind them. IT'S CRANE!
 | Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a heap.
 | Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.
 | Crane struggles to lift his head.
 | His head collapses to the ground.
SHIFU | He has gotten stronger.
 | Shifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -
 | He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly realizes where he is.
 | Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.
 | They look at each other. This is a big moment.
 | Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns to Po, holding it out.
PO | Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
 | Po takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to pull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.
 | He strains again. He tries to bite it off...
 | Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand. Po passes him the tube. Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.
 | He glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden light bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu, excited that he is witness to history...
 | On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.
 | Then -
 | But he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if off Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it and opens it again, astonished.
 | Shifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean?
 | Po sits heavily on the floor, dejected.
 | The Five don't argue.
 | Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He looks oddly calm as he turns around.
PO | What?
 | The Five and Po look devastated.
 | Shifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away.
 | Po resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off.
 | Monkey picks up a small child.
 | They split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate. Po is left by himself.
 | He makes his way through the bustling town.
JR SHAW | (skeptically) Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
 | Po approaches the Noodle Shop.
 | Seeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around his son. Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad pulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist.
 | Po's Dad goes back to packing things up.
 | Dad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following.
 | He turns and notices that Po hasn't moved. He walks to Po sympathetically.
 | Po slumps against the cart.
PO | I don't know, Dad. Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
 | Dad is taken aback.
 | Dad pauses dramatically.
 | Po feigns excitement.
 | Po looks at his father with dawning realization. He picks up the Scroll.
 | For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then he smiles serenely. He gets it now.
PO | There is no secret ingredient...
 | Po turns back to look at the palace.
 | They fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the doors of the Jade Palace.
 | Tai Lung enters.
 | Dissolve to FLASHBACK.
 | Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past dissolves into the present.
 | Shifu dodges each attack.
 | Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.
 | They fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
 | They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters into a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
 | Lightning flash.
 | Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's throat as they crash back through the roof.
 | They kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard. Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he charges at Shifu.
 | THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
 | Tai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's expression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.
 | He holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
 | Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.
 | Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.
 | Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
 | From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.
 | Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung, sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to run.
 | Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace steps.
 | Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
 | Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it, but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the noodle.
 | Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the street.
 | As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around to hide the scroll.
 | Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river.
 | Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the fireworks-filled sky.
 | Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie- vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is shocked.
 | As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the impact crater.
 | Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.
 | Po stirs.
 | Po gets to his feet.
 | Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
 | Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.
 | Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
 | Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY! He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground.
 | Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.
 | SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.
 | Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.
 | He flexes his pinky...
 | As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and his scarf is a torn apron.
 | Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the crowd.
 | Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.
 | Tigress bows deeply. The others follow.
 | Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then more steps.
 | Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
 | Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
 | Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
 | Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.
