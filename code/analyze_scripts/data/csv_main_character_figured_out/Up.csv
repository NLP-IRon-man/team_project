txt,"Quite a sight, huh Ellie? (noticing mailbox) Uhp, mail's here.
Shady Oaks Retirement. Oh brother.
Hm.
No. Yes. Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house.
I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear.
Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to him.
(in megaphone) You in the suit. Yes, you. Take a bath, hippy!
Tell your boss he can have our house.
When I'm dead! Carl SLAMS the door.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Uh, no. I'm doing fine.
Uh... kid...
Kid. KID!!
Thank you, but I don't need any help!

But skip to the end!
So you want to assist an old person?

Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me...
Oh, I don't know, it's awfully crafty. You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in.
I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past --
(calls after Russell) Bring it back here when you find it! Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.
What? Hey! Hey you! What do you think you're doing?
Don't touch that!

I don't want you to touch it! Carl HITS the worker with his cane. He falls to the sidewalk. The worker rubs his head. Blood.
What do I do now, Ellie?
Morning gentlemen.
Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this?
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I... want to say one last goodbye to the old place.
So long boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!
We're on our way, Ellie. Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate. He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair. He closes his eyes and smiles. SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.
Huh?
Hm.
What are you doing out here, kid?
No.
Oh, alright, you can come... Russell runs into the house past Carl.
...in.
Don't touch that. You'll soil it.
Kid, would you stop with the -- Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and forth.
Let go of the -- knock it off! Russell looks out the window in front of him.
(struggling to hold on) Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Well, that's not gonna work.
Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for what?
That's nice, kid.
What are you doing over there?
Wha... what happened?
Steered us?
Huh?
Can't tell where we are.
GP-what?
We'll get you down, find a bus stop. You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother.
There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare.
Well, we're up pretty high. Could take hours to get down. Something flashes by them in the fog. Carl leans forward.

We can't be close to the ground yet.
Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!
Whoah! Hey, hey! Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground.
Russell, hang on! Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.
Walk back! Walk back!
(out of breath) Where... where are we?
(to house) Don't worry, Ellie. I got it. The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped, flat-topped mountain on which they stand.
There it is. Ellie, it's so beautiful.
We made it. We made it! Russell, we could float right over there. Climb up. Climb up!
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
Watch it.
Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!
You on the porch yet?!
What? That's it?! I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great!
What are you talking about?
Walk it?
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing. Russell inspects his surroundings.
We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens...
...we're not getting to the falls!
Don't you worry, Ellie. We'll get our house over there. Russell looks up at the house. Who's Carl talking to?
Hey, let's play a game. It's called: ""See who can be quiet the longest.""
Darn thing. (calling back) C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?
Which knee?
I asked you about that five minutes ago!
Russell! If you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you.
Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into the bushes and do your business.
Eugh! None of my concern! Beat.
(humoring him) Oh, did you?
Oh yes, they're very tall.
They do indeed.
Oh ye- Chocolate?
What is that thing?!
There's no such thing as a snipe!
Go on, get out of here. Go on! Shoo!
Careful, Russell!
Russell! The bird grooms Russell.
Get out of here. Go on, git!
Aaaah!
""Kevin""?
Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!
Aaah! Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.
Go on, beat it.
No.
That doesn't even rhyme.
What? Get down! You're not allowed up there!
You come down here right now!
Sheesh! Can you believe this, Ellie?
(to Ellie) But I told him no -- (catches himself) I told you no! N-O. The bird HISSES at Carl.
I see you back there!
Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while.
Uh, hello?
Oh! Hello sir! Thank goodness.
It's nice to know someone else is up here!
What? You can smell us?
Hey.
What?
(calls out) We have your dog! (to self) Wonder who he belongs to?
Did that dog just say ""Hi there?""
Uh..wha?
It's not possible.
Russell, don't touch that. It could be radioactive or something. Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.
Yes! Take it! And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog!
No.
It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls.
I am not your master!
Russell! At this rate we'll never get to the falls!
I am nobody's master, got it? (points to bird) I don't want you here, (points to Dug) ...and I don't want you here. (points to Russell) I'm stuck with you. And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.
Ball? Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.
You want it boy? Huh? Huh? Yeah?
Go get it!! Carl throws the ball far away. Dug chases after it.

Just give it to me! Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.
Bird. Bird! Carl THROWS the chocolate. The bird runs after it.
C'mon Russell!
Daah!
Aaahh...
I think that did the trick.
Afternoon. Carl turns the other way. The bird. It HONKS at him.
Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie.
Wait, aren't you ""Super Wilderness Guy?"" With the GPM's and the badges?
No.
You've been camping before, haven't you?
Well, why didn't you ask your Dad how to build a tent?
Why don't you try him sometime? Maybe he'll surprise you.
He's got to be home sometime.
Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?
Oh.
Hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep. Don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus.
Alright. He can come.
Yeah.
Cross my heart.
What have I got myself into, Ellie?
Morning Sweetheart.
We better get moving.
Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice. (calls out) Alright, everybody up!
Hey, that's my food! Get off my roof!
What is it doing?
Sorry Russell. We've lost enough time already.
Huh?
Wait, we're not going with you. We're going to the falls! Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.
Get away from me! Get down!
Uh... yeah.
Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!
The Charles Muntz?
It's really him! (to Russell) That's Charles Muntz!
Him!
I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans!
Wow.
We're not actually going inside the ""Spirit of Adventure"" itself?!
Would I?!?!
Wait up, Mr. Muntz!
Jiminy Cricket.
Did you ever! Will you look at that?
Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise!
Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls.
You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose.
No!
But it ran off! It's gone now.
Well! It's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going.
We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. Come on Russell.
Hurry!
Russell!
Get back!! Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down! The dogs stop short.
Gimme your hand! Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird. Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE. A river winds 100 feet below.
Alright. But we've got to hurry.
See anything?
This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us! What a joke.
Careful Russell. The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the porch.
Yeah? How so?
Hmm, get used to that, kid.
Hold on Russell, stand still!
Look at that bird go!
Wait up, you overgrown chicken!
Russell, give me your knife!
No!
This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of this!
I am not your master! And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad dog!
Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me.
Russell?
Russell!
No, Russell! No! Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons have lost too much helium.
Wahhoo!
Russell?
Dug!
Can you stay? Well, you're my dog aren't you? And I'm your master!
Russell! Carl steers his house to the dirigible.
Dug! Bring `er over! Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to the dirigible ramp.
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here!
I don't want your help. I want you safe! Carl leaps back into the dirigible. Dug follows.
How do we get past these dogs?
Kevin!
Don't worry Kevin, we're on our way! Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above.

Who wants the ball?
Then go get it! Carl throws the ball. The dogs scramble after it.
I'm sorry Kevin. Let's get you out of here.
Come on, Kevin.
Come on!
Come on, Kevin!
(far in the distance) Russell!
Dug! Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.
Russell!! Over here!! Let's go!
Come on, Kevin! Carl helps Dug onto the porch. He climbs up himself...
No!
Russell! Get out of there! Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.
No! Leave them alone!
Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't let go of her!
Kevin! Chocolate!
Don't jerk around so much, kid! Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.
You know, it's just a house. Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship floating off over the clouds.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Huh, where's my cane? I just had it here... Kevin starts HACKING. She COUGHS up the cane.
You know what? Keep `em. A little gift from me to you. The bird family enters the labyrinth. Carl and Russell wave.
Ready!
(to Camp Master) I'm here for him.
Russell, for assisting the elderly, and for performing above and beyond the call of duty, I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow: The Ellie Badge.
Red one.
Red one.
It's red, isn't it?
No, I'm not. Red one.
Maybe I need new glasses.
","""Good afternoon. My name is Russell. And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?""
I could help you cross the street.
I could help you cross your yard.
I could help you cross your... porch?
Well, I gotta help you cross something.
""Good afternoon. My name is Russell.""
""And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12.""
""Are you in need of any assistance today Sir?""
Ow.
""Good afternoon. My-""
See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It's my Assisting the Elderly badge. If I get it I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a ""W"", his fingers the ""wings"" of a bird, then the ""claws"" of a bear.
""The wilderness must be explored!
It's gonna be great! There's a big ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges...
Yep! Then I will be a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Carl leans in close to Russell.
Snipe?
Me! Me! I'll do it!
I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!
Two blocks down! Got it!
Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell.
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse.
Please let me in?
Huh. I've never been in a floating house before.
Goggles. Look at this stuff! Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas.
Wow, you going on a trip? (reads from the engraving) ""Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time."" You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.
You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Russell runs over to the steering rig.
Whoah. Is this how you steer your house? Does it really work?
Oh, this makes it go right, and that way's left.
Hey look, buildings!
That building's so close I could almost touch it.
Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! (looking up) Hey, I can see your house from here!
I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo Nimbus. Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus...
...warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go by each other and that's how we get lightning.
(nearly silent) Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble, Mr. Fredricksen!
Look!
See? Cumulo Nimbus.
My pack!
Got ya!
Whew! I thought you were dead.
I steered us. I did! I steered the house!
After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here.
Oh we're in South America all right. It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.
My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.
Oops.
Sure, but I don't think they have busses in Paradise Falls.
Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?
Whoah! They slide toward the edge... and stop. The drop is thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.
Okay!
This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen. The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.
You mean assist you?
Okay, I'll climb up!
Sorry. The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.
Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge?
We could walk your house to the falls!
Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Carl considers this.

Sand!
I found sand!
Huh. (shrugs it off) This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!
Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again?
Cool! My mom loves that game!
I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.
My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom.
Well, I didn't have to go then! Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.
I don't want to walk anymore. Can we stop?
There's no tigers in South America. Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.
Zoology.
Okay! Here, hold my stuff.
I've always wanted to try this!
Huh? Tracks?!
Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe. Snipe! The footprints continue for a time, then stop.
Huh. Russell munches on a chocolate bar.
Ha! Gotcha!
Don't be afraid, little snipe. I am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a friend to all of nature. Want some more?
Hi boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.
Come on. Don't be afraid little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.
...giant snipe!
I found the snipe!
Are they tall?
Do they have a lot of colors?
Do they like chocolate?
It's a snipe!
But you said snipes eat--
Whoah! Russell GIGGLES.



Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!
Yeah, that's his name I just gave him.
Can we keep him? Please?? I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers...

Yeah it does. Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.
Hey, look! Kevin!
Ellie? (gets idea)
You were talking to a rock. Russell points to another rock shape.
Hey, that one looks like a turtle!
Look at that one! That one looks like a dog! The ""rock"" walks forward.
It is a dog!
Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.
Hey, I like dogs!
Sit boy.
Hey look, he's trained! Shake!
Uh-huh. Speak.
Cool! What do these do, boy?
Can we keep him? Please please please?
But it's a talking dog!
(on video screen) Hey Dug! Who you talking to?
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!
Hey! Quit it!
Why?
Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.
What are we doing?
Hey, uh, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss me.
Is this step three, or step five? Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.
There! Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into place.
All done. Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.
(pointing to tent) That's for you!
Awh. Tents are hard.
Yeah, but... can I tell you a secret?
Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it.
Well, never outside.
I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.
Well, he's away a lot. I don't see him much.
Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much.
Phyllis isn't my mom. Carl realizes he put his foot in it.
But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right?
Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him!
Can Kevin go with us?
Promise you won't leave him?
Cross your heart?
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!
Oh, look! There he is.
Her babies! Kevin's a girl? The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.
Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But you promised to protect her!
Her babies need her, we gotta make sure they're together.
Yeah...
This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there's more for you. Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.
Kevin?

Uh-huh.
I liked his other voice. Muntz LAUGHS.
Yes!! Russell is served a hot dog. His waiter can't resist and eats a bite.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, that looks like Kevin!
Yeah! That's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us.
She likes chocolate.
Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.
But we haven't even had dessert yet.
Kevin? Muntz walks to the window and looks out. Atop the roof he sees THE BIRD.
I am hurrying!
They're coming!
Help! Help!
Hang on to Kevin!
No no no! Kevin! Stay down. (to Carl) She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home?
You okay, Kevin? Kevin goes back to sleep. Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected.
It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book.
My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings.
And afterwards we'd go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle. Then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. I like that curb. He looks up at Carl.
That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most. They walk in silence. Carl understands.
Look, there it is!
That's it, go Kevin! Go find your babies!
Run Kevin! Run!
Oh no!
No! Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
Let her go! Stop!
Kevin! Carl beats out the flames with his jacket. He extinguishes the flames.
You gave away Kevin. You just gave her away.
I don't want this anymore. Russell walks away. He sits on a rock, alone.
I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't!
Ooph!
Yes! Don't worry Kevin! I'll save - Growling dogs move toward him.
Let me go!
He's not my friend anymore.
Where are you keeping Kevin!?
Let me go!
I'll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training!
Hey, where are you going? I'm not finished with you!
Mr. Fredricksen!
You came back for Kevin! Let's go get her.
But I want to help!
I want to help! He manages to get his arms free.
Ha ha!
Whoooaaah!
(out of breath) I can't do it!
Huh?
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!
Hey! (pointing down) Squirrel!
Mr. Fredricksen!
That was cool! Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin. The bird holds on to the hose with her beak. Carl LAUGHS, relieved.
Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen.
Look at you. You're so soft.
I wish I could keep one.
Bye Kevin! The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one last time before disappearing into the mist.
Ready? Carl gives a thumbs up.
Wow.
Blue one.
That's a bike!
Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating.
That's a fire hydrant.
","""Adventure is out there!"" In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.
Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster of Paradise Falls! He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.
I promise to capture the beast... alive!
And I will not come back until I do! The crowd CHEERS.
Well... Yes.
""Adventure is out there!""
Well, you're a man of good taste!
You must be tired. Hungry?
(to dogs) Attention everyone! These people are no longer intruders. They are our guests.
Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine.
Oh. Would you like to?
Most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums: New York, Munich, London... `Course I kept the best for myself.
Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring him down. A dog approaches carrying a menu. Muntz waves it off.
Oh, surprise me. (to Carl) Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as ""dental equipment!"" Muntz LAUGHS. Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one of the bones.
Oh, you recognize it? I'm impressed! That's an interesting story there...
Hm, excellent choice. (to Carl) I found it on safari with Roosevelt. Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle. POP! They sloppily pour two glasses.
He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings. And did he cheat? Oh, he was horrible!
Oh dear, broken translator. It's that loose wire again. (leans down, fixes it) There you go big fella.
Well, dinner is served! Right this way.
So how are things stateside? Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here... Please. Dogs pull back chairs for them. They sit. Dog waiters place napkins on their laps.
I hope you're hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had. Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look delicious.
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!
I'm honored. And now you've made it!
No no! It's a pleasure to have guests -- a real treat.
No no, quiet! Calm down. Calm down... In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.

They called me a fraud, those... dah! But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples, feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin.
Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings...
And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take! But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place.
""Kevin?""
Follow you? Impossible. How?
Chocolate?
You know, Carl. These people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories. A ""Surveyor"" making a map. Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table. It rolls across the floor.
A ""Botanist"" cataloguing plants.
An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls.
That's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends. Carl glances around nervously.
Oh, you're not leaving?
No, the boy's right. You haven't had dessert. Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee.
Oh, you really must stay. I insist! We have so much more to talk about!
It's here. He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.
(to dogs) Get them!
You lost them?
Wait. Wait a minute. Dug...
Careful. We want her in good shape for my return.
And they wouldn't believe me. Just wait till they get a look at you.
What?
Where's your elderly friend?
Well, if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind.
Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back. Guard that bird. If you see the old man, you know what to do.
Nice talking with you.
Where are you, Fredricksen?
What? Calm down! One at a time!
Does anyone know where they are?!?!
(into radio) Grey leader! Take down the house!
Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on, spit it out! Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz. He falls backwards.
Enough! I'm taking that bird back with me alive or dead! Carl trips and falls to the floor. Muntz is about to deal the final blow.
","Hi there.
Oh yes. Carl JUMPS back.
My name is Dug. I have just met you and I love you.
My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk -- SQUIRREL!! Dug stares transfixed at a tree. False alarm.
My master is good and smart.
Oh it is, because my master is smart.
Hey would you-
I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one and I have been on the scent. I am a great tracker, did I mention that? BAM! The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.
Hey, that is the bird! I have never seen one up close but this is the bird. (to Carl) May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner?
Oh I can bark! Dug BARKS.
And here's howling! Dug HOWLS. The bird HISSES at Dug.
Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh please be my prisoner.
Hi Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny.
Why yes, the bird is my prisoner now.
I am here with the bird and I will bring it back and then you will like me. Oh, gotta go. On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy's face. It's Russell.
Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my prisoner!
That man there says I can take the bird and I love that man there like he is my master.
I am warning you, once again, bird!
I am jumping on you now, bird.
A ball! Oh boy oh boy! A ball!
Oh oh oh! Yes, I do. I do ever so want the ball!
Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and then bring it back!
Hi, Master.
Find the bird. Find the bird...

Yeah, get off of his <>!
The bird is calling to her babies.
Her house is over there in those twisty rocks. Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH. The baby birds call from somewhere inside.
She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that.
Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and then I will again have the bird. Yes.
I do not like the Cone of Shame.
Go toward the light, master! Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.
Go on Master! I will stop the dogs! Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.
Stop you dogs!!
No, my pack is not following us! Boy they are dumb. Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house from behind a tree canopy.
Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a tree and says I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead. They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.
Master. It's alright.
I was hiding under your porch because I love you. Can I stay?
You are my master?! Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.
Oh boy. Oh boy!
Uh... POINT! Dug points to a grate in the wall.
Hi.
Listen you dog! Sit! Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits. All other dogs sit too.
Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is-
Master! The house bears down on them. They run to meet it.
Oh I am ready to not be up high. Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face. Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats softly down into the clouds, and disappears.
Grey one.
","(high-pitched voice) No. Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again.
Find the scent, my compadres and you two shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage.
Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire to -- SQUIRREL!
Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning?
Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now?
You are wise, my trusted Lieutenant.
This is Alpha calling Dug. Come in, Dug.
I know, I know! Have you seen the bird?
Impossible! Where are you?!
There he is. Come on!
(high-pitched voice) Where's the bird? You said you had the bird.
Where is it?
You lost it. Why do I not have a surprised feeling? Well, at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and The One Who Smells of Prunes.
Master will be most pleased we have found them, and will ask of them many questions. (commanding, to Carl) Come!
He has lost the bird. Put him in the Cone of Shame.
(high-pitched voice) Master, dinner is ready.
(deep scary voice) Thank you Master. Russell reacts.
Master! The small mailman has returned.
Allow no one to be entering through these doors. Guard well that bird, my minions.
I will have many enjoyments for what I am about to do, Dug.
(high-pitched voice) What? Do not just continue sitting! Attack!
(high pitched voice) No! No! Stop your laughing! Get this off of me!
