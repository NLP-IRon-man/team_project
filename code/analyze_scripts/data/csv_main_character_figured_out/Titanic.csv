txt,"Turn that up please, dear.
I'll be God damned.
I was just wondering if you had found the ""Heart of the Ocean"" yet, Mr.Lovett.Brock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked expression...
Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Oh, yes.Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishesarranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usualsnapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy ofcourse. (to the Pomeranian)Isn't that right, sweetie.
I should like to see my drawing.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing. (she points at the drawing)I only wore it this once.
It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people whocare greatly for money to give some away.
(indicating the drawing)You may give me this, if anything I tell you is of value.
This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I sawit.She turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the crackedglass.
The reflection has changed a bit.She spies something else, a silver and moonstone art-nouveau brooch.
My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss.Rose picks up an ornate art-nouveau HAIR COMB. A jade butterfly takesflight on the ebony handle of the comb. She turns it slowly, remembering.We can see that Rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions thathave lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb.
No, no. It's fine. I'm curious.Bodine starts a COMPUTER ANIMATED GRAPHIC on the screen, which parallelshis rapid-fire narration.
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course theexperience of it was somewhat less clinical.
No!Her voice is surprisingly strong. The sweet little old lady is gone,replaced by a woman with eyes of steel. Lovett signals everyone to stayquiet.
It's been 84 years...
(holds up her hand for silence)It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china hadnever been used. The sheets had never been slept in.He switches on the minirecorder and sets it near her.
Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was...As the underwater camera rises past the rusted bow rail, WE DISSOLVE /MATCH MOVE to that same railing in 1912...
I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than theMauretania.A PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDONHOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. ""Cal"" ishandsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning.
You told me to change.
I felt like black.Cal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded down with twotons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for Titanic's VictuallingDepartment.
(looking at a cubist portrait)You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth withoutlogic. What's his name again... ? (reading off the canvas)Picasso.
Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with sizemight be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay.Andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter.
Excuse me.She stalks away.
Stay back! Don't come any closer!Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the sternrunning lights.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and willnot do. You don't know me.
You're distracting me. Go away.
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.He takes off his jacket.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
(perplexed)No.
I know what ice fishing is!
You're crazy.
Alright.She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. Hereaches out to take it, firmly.
(voice quavering)Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height isterrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turningto face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, andone foot slips off the edge of the deck.She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, isjerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand.QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads forthe ladder.

Cal, stop! It was an accident.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.Rose looks at Jack, getting eye contact.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and Iwould have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almostwent over himself.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
My God... Cal. Is it a--
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.He gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Im afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.Lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out.
The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt.
Hello Jack.Fabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella.
Could I speak to you in private?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Mr. Dawson, I--
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up thenerve to face you.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... forpulling me back. But for your discretion.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What doesshe know about misery?
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it wastheir whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. (in a rush)I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at theback rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough.Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, Iwas over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
(she lowers her head)Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Worse I'm afraid.She shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond.
Yes, exactly!
If only it were that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
What's this?
May I?The question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book. Shesits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. ON JACK'S sketches... eachone an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleepingman, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive.His book is a celebration of the human condition.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
(laughing)You're deranged!She goes back to the book, turning a page.
Well, well...She has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languidbeauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive handsand eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form...almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as somestrollers go by.
(trying to be very adult)And these were drawn from life?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
(smiling)I think you must have had a love affair with her...
(looking up from the drawings)You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
And...?
(girlish and excited)You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become anartist... living in a garret, poor but free!
(angry in a flash)Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing mydreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know whatit is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. LikeIsadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she seessomething ahead and her face lights up.
...or a moving picture actress!She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward--DANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera asshe poses stiffly at the rail.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
A whole ten cents?!
(looks at the dusk sky)Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feellike it. (turning to him)Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever justtalk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
(smiling at him)I think I would. (she looks at the horizon)And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit.It's unfair.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Shall we go dress, mother? (over her shoulder)See you at dinner, Jack.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest manon the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicatecondition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal. (nodding toward a couple)And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designsnaughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals.Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and ColonelGracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picotsJack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably.
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs.Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course.Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who arelooking at Rose like a prize show horse.
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.
To making it count.Ruth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him further.
Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in thislittle book. (grabs it and reads)Increase number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3. You build the biggestship in the world and this preoccupies you?!Andrews smiles sheepishly.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
(low, to Jack)Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room.
(low)Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on beingmasters of the universe.
Jack, must you go?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
Wait... stop!She bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them toTommy. Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancingfaster as the music speeds up.
You think a first class girl can't drink?Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy,who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She laughs, not caring. But Tommylunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around.
So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this.In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes upon point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gapeat her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screwsup in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around.
Oooowww! I haven't done that in years.Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up.THE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches throughthe gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing.LOVEJOY closes the door.
Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless.She goes to the rail and leans on it.
They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants onthe earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside thislittle tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst.He leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers. It is theslightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is thatsquare inch of skin where their hands are touching.
A mistake?
(laughing)I did, didn't I?
(pointing suddenly)Look! A shooting star.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. Itwould be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seemsto be thinking the same thing.
Something I can't have. (she smiles sadly)Goodnight, Jack. And thank you.She leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance.
I was tired.
(stiffening)I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am yourfiancee--Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. Hemoves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping thesides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms.
We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy.
Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed.Ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. CLACK!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
(hurt and lost)How can you put this on my shoulders?Rose turns to her, and we see what Rose sees-- the naked fear in hermother's eyes.
It's so unfair.
(singing)O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboatstimes the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there arenot enough for everyone aboard.
Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.He takes her by the shoulders.
Jack, I--
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes,leave me alone.
Oh, look what I've done.
Hello, Jack.He turns and she is standing there.
I changed my mind.He smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are red with thechill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows wildly about her face.
Fabrizio said you might be up--
I'm flying!She leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on her waist tosteady her.
That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.Brock Lovett changes the tape in the minicassette recorder.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere.
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.CLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirrorbehind the safe. She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it outto Jack who takes it nervously.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.Jack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension.
I want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this. (she smiles at him)Wearing only this.He looks up at her, surprised, and we CUT TO:104 ROSE'S BEDROOM. ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it out of her hair.She shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders.105 IN THE SITTING ROOM Jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools.His sketchbook is open and ready. He looks up as she comes into the room,wearing a silk kimono.
The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll.As a paying customer, I expect to get what I want.She hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono. The blue stonelies on her creamy breast. Her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers therobe.Jakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono drops to the floor(this is all in cuts, lyrical).
Tell me when it looks right to you.She poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position we rememberfrom the drawing... almost.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monetblushing.
Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this night.He does: 4/14/1912. Rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a piece of Titanicstationary. We don't see what it says. She accepts the drawing from him,and crosses to the safe in the wardrobe.She puts the diamond back in the safe, placing hte drawing and the note ontop of it. Closes the door with a CLUNK!
Come on!She and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and gentlemenabout. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators. They runinto one, shocking the hell out of the OPERATOR.
Take us down. Quickly, quickly!The Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate.Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on thebars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughsas Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble...to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch,after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
To the stars.ON JACK as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seatinto the back. He lands next to her, and his breath seems loud in the quietdarkness. He looks at her and she is smiling. It is the moment of truth.
Au contraire, mon cher.He strokes her face, cherishing her. She kisses his artist's fingers.
Put your hands on me Jack.He kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight.
You're trembling.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.Jack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely.130 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet nudges Lee.
Could it have damaged the ship?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Something serious has happened.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you--Steward Barnes pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of the pocket of Jack'scoat.
(uncertain)He couldn't have.
But I was with him the whole time.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell methe truth.
You're certain?
Yes, I understand. Thankyou.Andrews goes off, moving among the passengers and urging them to put ontheir lifebelts and get to the boats.
Oh, Mother shut up! (Ruth freezes, mouth open)Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enoughboats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
You unimaginable bastard.
Goodbye, mother.Ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing. Cal grabs Rose's armbut she pulls free and walks away through the crowd. Cal catches up to Roseand grabs her again, roughly.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.He clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling her back towardthe lifeboat. Rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it. he lets gowith a curse and she runs into the crowd.
That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd!Appalled, they turn to see Cal running toward them. Rose runs on as the twomen grab Cal, restraining him. She runs throught the First Class entrance.Cal breaks free and runs after her. He reaches the entrance, but runs intoa knot of people coming out. He pushes rudely through them...
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone underarrest?!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will takelonger.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
I'm through with being polite, goddamnit!! I may never be polite the restof my life! Now take me down!!The operator fumbles to close the gate and start the lift.
Left, crew passage.She spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor. The place isunderstandably deserted. She is on her own.
Right, right... right.She turns into a cross-corridor, splashing down the hall. A row of doors oneach side.
Jack? Jaaacckk??
Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.They are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing.
I know, I know.
I didn't. (she looks at him)I just realized I already knew.They share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, searchingdrawers and cupboards. Jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out.A LIFEBOAT hits the surface of the water, seen from below.
There's no key in here.They look around at the water, now almost two feet deep. Jack has pulledhis feet up onto the bench.
(nodding)I'll be right back.
Hello? Somebody?!She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hallslopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin ofthe water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through thewater, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, hiseyes crazed...
Help me! We need help!He doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs withterrifying sounds.The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then theycome back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment ofblackness was the most terrifying of her life.A STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He isupset to see someone still in his section. He grabs her forcefully by thearm, pulling her with him like a wayward child.
Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's--
No, let me go! You're going the wrong way!He's not listening. And he won't let her go.She SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in thenose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back.
See you there, buster!The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Justthe way Jack taugh: her.She turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. She breaks theglass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizesthe axe, running back the way she came.192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded thebottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along thecorridor to the room where Jack is trapped.Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and powersforward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. She grimaces at thepain from the literally freezing water.
Will this work?
Move aside! Quickly, move aside!Jack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT INTO THE GATEwith all their strength. It rips loose from its track and falls outward,narrowly mssing the steward. Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rosesteps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone:
If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job
with the White Star Line, I suggest you escort these good people to theboat deck... now.Class wins out. He nods dumbly motions form them to follow.
The boats are gone!She sees Colonel Gracie chugging forward along the deck, escorting twofirst class ladies.
Colonel! Are there any boats left?
I'm not going without you.
No. Not without you!She doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there. He sees the emotionbetween Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. But then he leans close to herand says...
You jump, I jump, right?
We can't leave him.Jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run tothe child. Jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but--A torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. In seconds itis too powerful for them to go against.
No! Not that way! Come back!228 DOUBLE DOORS BLAST OPEN. A wall of water thunders into the corridor.The father and child DISAPPEAR instantly.Jack and Rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming from floor toceiling. It gains on them like a locomotive. They make it to a stairwaygoing up.
Help us! Please!The steward stops and looks back. He sees Jack and Rose at the gate, theirarms raching through... sees the water POURING through the gate onto thelanding.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
(hugging him)And to you, Mr. Andrews.Jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door.
I trust you.Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... theboiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the lastthirty feet.278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The nameTITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under thewater.Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean.
It's so cold.
What's that?Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is apiece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and sheslithers onto it belly down.But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges,almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. Heclings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as besthe can.Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. AMAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns himback.
Thank God for you Jack.People are still screaming, calling to the lifeboats.
It's getting quiet.
I love you Jack.He takes her hand.
I'm so cold.
I can't feel my body.
I promise.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.She grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. It is quiet now,except for the lapping of the water.
""Come Josephine in my flying machine...""ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way aglorious band from horizon to horizon.A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens.TIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals.Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track downfrom the stars to the water.ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars.She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water,leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men soundslow and DISTORTED.Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares acrossthe water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past hermotionless form and moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving pasther. The men look away.Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to thewood under her.
(barely audible)Jack.She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rosegently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost.He seems to be sleeping peacefully.But he is not asleep.Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her.
Oh, Jack.All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is furtheraway now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go.She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reasonto even try.And then... her eyes snap open.She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off thewood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boatis invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She strugglesto draw breath, calling again.292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to somethingahead, turning the tiller.293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen toJack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclaspstheir hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film.
I won't let go. I promise.She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade outlike a spirit returning to some immaterial plane.Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. Sheswims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts toBLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps acrossthe still water.294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that issomething you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor Ifor you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me.In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never cometo light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased.She fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed theirlives.
Is this in any way unclear?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.She stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal stricken withemotion.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.We see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her.After a moment, he turns and walks away.
Dawson. Rose Dawson.The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walksforward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesiumflashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a suddendisturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running toembrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. Thereporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode.Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through thejostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in theconfusion.
Don't come any closer.
The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time Ithough of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by withouthis help.She holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys comeup behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand.
I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs.The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand...
You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life ispriceless, and making each day count.His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond outof his hand. He feels it sliding away.Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail.Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hitthe water and disappear forever.
","(jaunty)Hit me again, Sven.Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand.ECU JACK'S EYES. They betray nothing.CLOSE ON FABRIZIO licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card.ECU STACK in the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four counrties.This has been going on for a while. Sitting on top of the money are two 3RDCLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC.The Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning.
The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change.Fabrizio puts his cards down. So do the Swedes. Jack holds his close.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh...two pair... mmm. (turns to his friend)Sorry Fabrizio.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...He slaps a full house down on the table.
(grinning)'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
(to the Swedes)Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I'm high and you're dry and... (to Fabrizio)... we're going to--
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! Onthe TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamnedroyalty, ragazzo mio!!
Shit!! Come on, Fabri! (grabbing their stuff)Come on!! (to all, grinning)It's been grand.They run for the door.
Wait!! We're passengers!Flushed and panting, he waves the tickets.
(lying cheerfully)Of course! Anyway, we don't have lice, we're Americans. (glances at Fabrizio)Both of us.
(grabbing Fabrizio's arm)Come on, Sven.Jack and Fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the white-paintedcorridero... grinning from ear to ear.
We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world!
Of course not. That's not the point. (to the crowd)Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!Grinning, Fabrixio joins in, adding his voice to the swell of voices,feeling the exhilaration of the moment.
That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things.
Don't do it.She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second forher eyes to focus.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No you won't.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so shewipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
I'm a good swimmer.He starts unlacing his left shoe.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot moreconcerned about the water being so cold.She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in.
(taking off his left shoe)Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.He starts unlacing his right shoe.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there,near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father wereice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole inthe--
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went throughsome thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right downthere... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can'tbreath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. (takes off his other shoe)Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like Isaid, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back overthe rail and get me off the hook here.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the onehanging off the back of a ship.He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse.
Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and theysomehow suddenly seem to fill her universe.
I'm Jack Dawson.
I've got you. I won't let go.Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railingwith his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smoothhull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get anyfooting in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMSagain.Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as sheflails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in atangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top ofher.Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drilland sprints across the fantail.
Uh huh. That was pretty much it.He looks at Rose a moment longer. Now they have a secret together.
(looking straight at Rose)Sure. Count me in.
(as Lovejoy passes)Can I bum a cigarette?Lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps itopen. Jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear forlater. Lovejoy lights Jack's cigarette.
Hello again.
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.He motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his shoulder, oneeyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence.
So, you got a name by the way?
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.There is an awkward pause.
Jack.
Well, here you are.
You're welcome. Rose.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could havehappened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom.They laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not afirst class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you'remarryin' this fella.
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
Well, I guess I will tonight.Looking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook.
Just some sketches.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack scramblesafter them... catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.He snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish.
I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway.For emphasis he throws away the two he caught. They sail off.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing taketheir clothes off.She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight,half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like aflower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz printof Georgia O'Keefe.
She had beautiful hands.
(laughing)No, no! Just with her hands.
I see you.There it is. That piercing gaze again.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
(laughing)You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever anycaviar.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to LosAngelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have arollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
(not getting it)Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. Butonly in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what thereal artists were doing.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoasteruntil we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in thesurf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Sure. If you like.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watchclosely.He spits. It arcs out over the water.
Your turn.Rose screws up her mouth and spits. A pathetic little bit of foamy spittlewhich mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water.
Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!...then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breathand PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing?She goes through the steps. Hawks it down, etc. He coaches her through it(ad lib) while doing the steps himself. She lets fly. So does he. Twocomets of gob fly out over the water.
That was great!Rose turns to him, her face alight. Suddenly she blanches. He sees herexpression and turns.RUTH, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been watching themhawking lugees. Rose becomes instantly composed.
Not really.
I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it.
Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up.
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astorappraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose:
The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats.Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate.
(to the waiter)No caviar for me, thanks. (to Cal)Never did like it much.He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles.
Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God'sgood humor.Salad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look andpicks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks.
Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My fatherwas always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he wasborn in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you neverknow what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a firewhen I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like thatteaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count.Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute.
I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticketon Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker. (he glances at Rose)A very lucky hand.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.He leans over to take her hand.INSERT: We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm.Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room. Rosesurreptitiously opens the note below table level. It reads: ""Make it count.Meet me at the clock"".
Want to go to a real party?
You're still my best girl, Cora.Cora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is trembling as hetakes her right hand in his left. His other hand slides to the small of herback. It is an electrifying moment.
Just move with me. Don't think.The music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, she starts toget into it. She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of thesteops.
How you two doin'?
Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishmangoin' to the whorehouse?Tommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. Then he grinsand claps Bjorn on the shoulder.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, itwas a soul going to heaven.
What would you wish for?After a beat, Rose pulls back.
Rose!!But the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world.
I was just here last night... don't you remember? (seeing Lovejoy coming toward him)He'll tell you.
I don't want money, I--
I just need to talk to Rose for a--
It was them, not her. (glancing around the deck)Ready... go.Tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, crouchingdown. Jack steps into Tommy's hands and gets boosted up to the next deck,where he scrambles nimbly over the railing, onto the First Class deck.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under thatyou're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girlI've ever known and--
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I havenothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, Ijump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to bealright.Rose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... notlike anyone she has ever known.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, andyou're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'causeyou're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Sssshh. Come here.He puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her.
Close your eyes.She does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. Hepresses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takesher two hands and raises them until she is standing with her armsoutstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers hishands, her arms stay up... like wings.
Okay. Open them.Rose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's likethere is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. TheAtlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky.There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below.
(singing softly)Come Josephine in my flying machine...Rose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above thesea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back againsthis chest. He pushes forward slightly against her.Slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers...fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly,their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of twolovers.Jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of herwash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear.Rose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms,turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his armsaround her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned andtilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. Theykiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion.Jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism,lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward intoa night without fear.100 IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout FREDERICK FLEETnudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down at the figures in the bow.
(bad French accent)Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. (seeing the paintings)Hey... Monet!He crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall.
Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole inthis garden fence in Giverny.She goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees her go to thesafe and start working the combination. He's fascinated.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
What is it? A sapphire?
Uh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes tome. That's it.Jack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh.
(sweating)He does landscapes.TIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of hissketchpad. We have seen this image of him before, in her memory. It is animage she will carry the rest of her life.Despite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and what emerges isthe best thing he has ever done. Her pose is languid, her hands beautiful,and her eyes radiate her energy.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh!Lovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. He charges towardthem. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is onedoor, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open.115 They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down.Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it amoment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing to the ladder.
After you, m'lady.
(shouting over the din)Carry on! Don't mind us!They run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pullsher through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up inthe dark, out of sight of the working crew. Watching from the shadows, theysee the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into theinsatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders with the roar ofthe fires.
Where to, Miss?
Are you nervous?
It's okay. I'm alright.He lays his cheek against her chest.
I can feel your heart beating.She hugs his head to her chest, and just holds on for dear life.
This is crazy.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.Behind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice around the deck,laughing.
(low, to her)It's bad.
Now it's worse.
Right.Jack follows Rose through the door inside the ship.
This is horseshit.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
They put it in my pocket!
I was going to return it! Rose--Rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks away from him.He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him outinto the hall. She can't look him in the eye.
Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You knowit!She is devastated. Her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as tetears well up.
Shit.He tries to pull one hand out of the cuffs, working until the skin israw... no good.
Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear me?! (to himself)This could be bad.181 THE CORRIDOR outside is deserted. Flooded a couple of inches deep.Jack's voice comes faintly through the door, but there is no one to hearit.
ROSE!! In here!187 IN THE HALL Rose hears his voice behind her. She spins and runs back,locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave.She splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brassone.She kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
I'll wait here.She runs out, looking back at him once from the doorway, then splashesaway. Jack looks down at the swirling water.
We'll find out.They are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. He positions thechain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe.The chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on eitherside of it.
Try a couple practice swings.Rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet.
Now try to hit the same mark again.She swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark.
Okay, that's enough practice.He winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. She has to hit a targetabout an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands oneither side.
(sounding calm)You can do it, Rose. Hit it as hard as you can, I trust you.Jack closes his eyes. So does she.The axe comes down. K-WHANG! Rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... Jack isgrinning with two separate cuffs.Rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her.
Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan.He climbs down into the water next to her. He can't breathe for a second.
Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, that is cold! Come on, let's go.They wade out into the hall. Rose starts toward the stiars going up, butJack stops her. There is only about a foot of the stairwell openingvisible.
Too deep. We gotta find another way out.
Fabrizio! Fabri!Fabrizio turns and sees Jack and Rose pushing through the crowd. He andJack hug like brothers.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?Fabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to thestairwell.Tommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head ofthe stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women aresqueezing through.
Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast.Fabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood.
God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!!He grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing. He startspulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and itbreaks free. Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up thestairs between the waiting people.
You better check out the other side.They nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse.
Get in the boat, Rose.Cal walks up just then.
Go on. I'll get the next one.
(he smiles reassuringly)I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat tocatch.
Almost as good as you.
No Rose! NOOOO!!Jack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to A-Deck.Hockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for this man, thisgutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses allthought.
Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot--And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can.
Right.Hockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them lockedin their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HANDon him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistbandin one cobra-fast move.He RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing abovethem he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES.The carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pullsRose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again,running down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oakpanelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight ofstairs.Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goessprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, andreeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.
(whispering)Stay here.He moves off as--Lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables. Nothing.The ship GROANS and CREAKS. He moves another row.ANGLE ON A METAL CART... five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes.It starts to roll down the aisle between tables.ON ROSE as the cart rolls toward her. It hits a table and the stacks ofdishes topple out, EXPLODING across the floor and showering her.She scrambles out of the way and--Lovejoy spins, seeing her. He moves rapidly toward her, keeping the gunaimed--That's when Jack tackles him from the side. They slam together into atable, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor. They land in the waterwhich is flowing rapidly between the tables.Jack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water. Jack jams his knee down onLovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, and kicks it away. Lovejoyscrmbles up and lunges at him, but Jack GUTPUCHES him right in the solarplexus, doubling him over.
Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.He grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb. Lovejoy drops to thefloor with a splas, stunned.
Let's go.Jack and Rose run aft... uphill... entering the galley. Behind them thetables have become islands in a lake... and the far end of the room isflooded up to the ceiling.Lovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun. He pulls it up out of thewater and wades after them.
Come on.Charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray witheach footstep. At the end of the hall are heavy double doors. As Jackapproaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doorsright up to the ceiling. The doors groan and start to crack under the tonsof pressure.
Back! Go back!!Rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into across-corridor. A MAN is coming the other way. He sees the boy in Jack'sarms and cries out, grabbing him away from Jack. Starts cursing him inRussian. He runs on with the boy--
Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.The steward runs on. The water wells up around Jack and Rose, pouringthrough the gate and slamming them against it. In seconds it is up to theirwaist.
Come on! Come on!Jack and Rose are right up against the ceiling...Suddenly the gate gives and SWINGS OPEN. They are pushing through by theforce of the water. They make it to stairs on the other side of the landingand follow the steward up to the next deck.
(to her)It's going fast... we've got to keep moving.Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her.
Okay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long aspossible.They push their way aft through the panicking crowd.
You wanna walk a little faster through that valley, fella?
Come on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us.They struggle on, pushing through the praying people. A MAN loses hisfooting ahead and slides toward them. Jack helps him.261 THE PROPELLERS are twenty feet above the water and rising faster.262 JACK AND ROSE make it to the stern rail, right at the base of theflagpole. They grip the rai, jammed in between other people. It is the spotwhere Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two night... and aliftime... ago.Above the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, cracking withemotion.
We have to move!He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrifiedto move. He grabs her hand.
Come on! I've got you!Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over therail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just asthe railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips herfiercely.The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolithstanding against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note,its buoyancy stable.Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling seaat the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over,hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fallone by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some ofthem bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators.Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull,gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet arethe gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern.Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them.Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull,holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment.
(talking fast)Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The shipwill suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go ofmy hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me.She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder.
Swim, Rose! SWIM!She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of herlifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kindof flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water.
Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it.All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... achorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black waterstretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness isoverwhelming.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them.Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turnsand... SCREAMS.A DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG,swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyesbugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland.Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water.
It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under.
You'll die quicker if you come any closer.
The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. Theyhad to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back.She nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lipsblue and her teeth chattering.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boatsorganized...Rose is unmoving, just staring into space. She knows the truth. There won'tbe any boats. Behind Jack she sees that Officer Wilde has stopped moving.He is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep. He has died ofexposure already.
I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter tothe White Star Line about all this.She laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. Rose finds his eyesin the dim light.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're goingto make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady,warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing thatever happened to me.Jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak.
It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful.His voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart.But his eyes are unwavering.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you willnever give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless...promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Never let go.
","You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's overa hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It hassquash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths.Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, whodescends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a 40ish society empress,from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, andrules her household with iron will.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. (indicating a puddle)Mind your step.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience.This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, aquintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete withservants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as anundertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth andRose.A WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minuteloading.
I put my faith in you, good sir.
(curtly, indicating Lovejoy)See my man.
We'd better hurry. This way, ladies.He indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into thecrowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of hermistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggagehandlers.Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers(mostly second class and steerage) and well-wishers. Most of the firstclass passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd byusing an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above.They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds,queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICERexamines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice.They pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph""cinematograph"" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose fatherfounded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front ofthe Titanic. MARY MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious.
Steady!!
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beautyrituals which made us late.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship inhistory, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going toyour execution.Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them...a great iron wall,Bible black and sever. Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangwayto the D Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
(coming into the sitting room)He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.A porter wheels Cal's private safe (which we recognize) into the room on ahandtruck.
Put that in the wardrobe.47 IN THE BEDROOM Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers. She setsit on the dresser, near the canopy bed. Trudy is already in there, hangingup some of Rose's clothes.
(looking at Rose)And when I crawl between the sheets tonight, I'll still be the first.
The first and only. Forever.Rose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her, now.
She knows.Cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out.
(to the waiter)We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little mint sauce. (to Rose, after the waiter moves away)You like lamb, don't you sweetpea?Molly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth.
(tense but feigning unconcern)Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me,you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
An accident?!
You wanted to see the propellers?
(rubbing her arms)Let's get you in. You're freezing.Cal is leaving without a second thought for Jack.
Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?Cal turns back to Jack. He appraises him condescendingly... a steerageruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered.
I know. (to Jack)Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group withyour heroic tale?
Good. Settled then.Cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose. he leans close toGracie as they walk away.
This should be amusing.
(unexpectedly tender)I know you've een melancholy, and I don't pretent to know why.From behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel case. Shetakes it, numbly.
I intended to save this till the engagement gals next week. But I thoughttonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you...Rose slowly opens the box. Inside is the necklace... ""HEART OF THE OCEAN""in all its glory. It is huge... a malevolent blue stone glittering with aninfinity of scalpel-like inner reflections.
Daimond. Yes it is. 56 carats.He takes the necklace and during the following places it around her throat.He turns her to the mirror, staring behind her.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer,the--
It's for royalty. And we are royalty.His fingers caress her neck and throat. He seems himself to be disarmed byRose's elegance and beauty. His emotion is, for the first time, unguarded.
There's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you if youwould deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose.CAMERA begins to TRACK IN ON ROSE. Closer and closer, during the following:
(caught off guard)Dawson! I didn't recognize you. (studies him)Amazing! You could almost pass for a gentlemen.
Thank you.
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to myfiancee last night. (to Jack, as if to a child)This is foie gras. It's goose liver.We see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Nowthey're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous.
(answering for him)Just a soupcon of lemon... (to Jack, smiling)...it improves the flavor with champagne.
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.Rose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in hisnotebook, completely ignoring the conversation.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing.Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.Cal and te other gentlemen exit.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you willhonor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be madeout a fool! Is this in any way unclear?Rose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through thedoor bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightensup. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom.
Reminds me of my Harvard days.T.W. McCAULEY, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in whiteflannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his present-daycounterpart on an ""Abflex"" infomercial. He hits a switch and a machine witha saddle on it starts to undulate. Rose puts her hand on it, curious.
(slapping the side of a boat)Waste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship!
(low but forceful)This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
I have a better idea.
Yes there is, I have been robbed. Now get the Master at Arms. Now youmoron!
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now thatone is back... (he looks from Rose to Jack)... I have a pretty good idea where to fine the other. (to Master at Arms)Search him.The Master at Arms steps up to Jack.
That's it.
Of course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized thecombination when you opend the safe.FLASHBACK: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's eyesas he stands behind her, watching.
(just to her, low and cold)Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
It is a little slut, isn't it?To Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has beengiven. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly.
Look at me, you little--There is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The door opens andtheir steward puts his head in.
Get out. We're busy.The steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of adresser.
This is ridiculous.In the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequiousthey are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever. However, it's anotherstory in...
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
My God.Now it is Cal's turn to look stunned. The Titanic? Sinking?
Stay here, Ruth.Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time.
Not the better half.PUSH IN ON ROSE'S FACE as it hits her like a thunderbolt. Jack is thirdclass. He doesn't stand a chance. Another rocket bursts overhead, bathingher face in white light.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... (indicating Lightoller)...isn't letting any men in at all.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance. (he starts off forward)Come on.Cal charges off, heading forward, followed by Lovejoy. The SHOT HANDS OFFto a finely dressed elderly couple, IDA and ISADOR STRAUSS.
(holding up stacks of bills)I make my own luck.
Ben, what's the occasion?
That's admirable, Ben. (walking on)I'll sure and tell your wife... when I get to New York.
We're too late.
It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time.Cal sees three dogs run by, including the black French bulldog. Someone hasreleased the pets from the kennels.Cal sees Murdoch turn from the davits of boat 15 and start walking towardthe bow. He catches up and falls in beside him.
Mr. Murdoch, I'm a businessman, as you know, and I have a businessproposition for you.
So we have an understanding then?
God damn it to hell! Come on.He and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut through thebridge.Bruce Ismay, seeing his oppurtunity, steps quickly into Collapsible C. Hestares straight ahead, not meeting Murdoch's eyes.
Yes. Get in the boat, Rose.She is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. Cal looks ather, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shockingdisplay in 1912.
My God, look at you. (taking off his boat)Here, put this on.She numbly shrugs into it. He is doing it for modesty, not the cold.
(low)There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I canget off safely. Both of us.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.Lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She reaches out forJack and her fingers brush his for a moment. Then she finds herselfstepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur.
(low)You're a good liar.
I always win, Jack. One way or another. (looks at him, smiling)Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more bymorning.Jack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste asecond of his last view of her.222 ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through thepulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightollergiving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding inher ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above inslow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing inslow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she seeshis hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannotbelieve the unbearable pain she is feeling...Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face.SUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reachesthe gunwale, climbing it...Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck promenade, catchingit, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat 2 continues down. But Rose isback on Titanic.
(calling to them)Enjoy your time together!!Lovejoy arrives next to him. Cal suddenly remembers something and starts tolaugh.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.He turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes glittering.
I give it to you... if you can get it.He hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs. Lovejoy thinksabout it... then slogs into the water. The icewater is up to his waist ashe crosses the pool into the dining saloon.
We had a deal, damn you.Murdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal.
(forcing his way through the crowd)Here's a child! I've got a child!
(to McElroy)Please... I'm all she has in the world.McElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins with his gun,brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. Cal gets into theboat, holding the little girl. He takes a seat with the women.
There, there.
Get back! You'll swamp us!Fabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes andpulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he isdragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks backto the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water.247 WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them.He holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers hisviolin.
(to the crew in the boat)Row! Row you bastards!!250 NEARBY: Fabrizio is drawn up against the grating of a STOKEHOLD VENT aswater pours through it. The force of tons of water roaring down the shiptraps him against it, and he is dragged down under the surface as the shipsinks. He struggles to free himself but cannot.Suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as a furnaceexplodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator, ejectingFabrizio. He surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming.
Stay back! Keep off!Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. CalCLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp.
(pointing with the oar)It's that way!CLOSE ON FABRIZIO as he floats, panting each breath agony. You see thespirit leave him.FABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demonin a tuxedo. The image fades to black.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you--She holds up her hand, stopping him.
(after a long beat)What do I tell your mother?
You're precious to me, Rose.
","It still gets me every time.The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, tothe bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns.
Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here.Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the cameraaimed at himself at arm's length.
It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great shipsitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912,after her long fall from the world above.Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watchesthe sonar.
Right. Let's go to work.Bodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystickcontrols of the ROV.9 OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOPDOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door.SEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts movingdebris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they werein 1912.
Easy, Lewis. Take it slow.Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls itwith Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it isa dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was underthe door...
Oh baby baby baby. (grabs the mike)It's payday, boys.ON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: asmall STEEL COMBINATION SAFE.
You are, Lewis. (to the video crew)You rolling?
Well, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if thetime, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, tocome out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If whatwe think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be.Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet. The dooris pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett moves closer, peering intothe safe's wet interior. A long moment then... his face says it all.
Shit.
(to the video cameraman)Get that outta my face.
You send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks,not 60 minutes. Now get set up for the uplink.Buell covers the phone and turns to Lovett.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!Lovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth.
Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry aboutit, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris inthe suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck... (seeing something)Hang on a second.A tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong...revealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of a woman.Brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though itsedges have partially disintegrated. The woman is beautiful, and beautifullyrendered. In her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posedwith a kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool oflight that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled in the lowerright corner is the date: April 14 1912. And the initials JD.The girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond necklace with onelarge stone hanging in the center.Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. It is aperiod black-and-white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvetjeller's display stand. He holds it next to the drawing. It is clearly thesame piece... a complex setting with a massive central stone which isalmost heart-shaped.
I'll be God damned.
Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THEshipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks.
Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb graverobbing. I have museum-trained experts here, making sure this stuff ispreserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was foundtoday...The video camera pans off Brock to the drawing, in a tray of water. Theimage of the woman with the necklace FILLS FRAME.
...a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years... and my team areable to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottomof the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...?ROSE is galvanized by this image. Her mouth hangs open in amazement.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water?Take a message.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs... ?
... Mrs. Calvert?
(to Rose)Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in thepicture is?
A hundred and one next month.
And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or onthis ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say.Got it?
Is your stateroom alright?
Would you like anything?
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of theCrown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything fromthe neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too...recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. TheHeart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that wassettled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was,Rost?
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace hisson Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a weekbefore he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after thesinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. (to Lizzy)See the date?
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the dayTitanic sank.
(to Rose)And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you foranything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Deal. (crossing the room)Over here are a few things we've recovered from your staterooms.Laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane to valuable.Rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see over the table top. With atrembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with motherof pearl. She caresses it wonderingly.
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Will you share it with us?Her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them.A VIEW from one of the subs TRACKING SLOWLY over the boat deck. Roserecognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in place. She hears ghostlywaltz music. The faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, Englishaccented, calling ""Women and children only"".30 FLASH CUTS of screaming faces in a running crowd. Pandemonium andterror. People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck. Just impressions...flashes in the dark.31 Rose Looks at another monitor. SNOOP DOG moving down a rusted,debris-filled corridor. Rose watches the endless row of doorways slidingpast, like dark mouths.32 IMAGE OF A CHILD, three years old, standing ankle deep in water in themiddle of an endless corridor. The child is lost alone, crying.33 Rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions. Her eyes well upand she puts her head down, sobbing quietly.
Tell us, Rose.She looks from screen to screen, the images of the ruined ship.
Just tell us what you can--
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
(warningly)Lewis...But Rose laughs with Bodine.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it afterthat?
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to thesafe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.Lovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern ofthe ship.
Oh shit.
You had it the entire time?!FLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 54. Thephotographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her handsin her pockets. She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace.She stares at it in amazement.BACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension.
Don't drop it Rose.
(to Bodine)It's hers, you schmuck. (to her)Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump offthe Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is...we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think aboutthis a second.
Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once.He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to herat the stern of Titanic.Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand,while still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of hisquest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It ismesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined.
My God.His grip tightens on the diamond.He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise anddeep.
Would you like to dance?Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars.308 IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end overend, into the infinate depths.
