txt,"...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity. Mia stops. Thinks. Mutters to herself: ""Insanity""... Then leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger seat. It's a SCRIPT.
(reading now) Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. She's too focused on her lines to notice. Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. Mia comes to. Jerked back to reality. The honking car behind her swerves into the next lane. It's Sebastian. Mia gives him the finger. We then FOLLOW her as she drives...
Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --
Shit. Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as --
It's -- five past...
Ok. -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. Coffee and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're --
And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... Revision 4. Her nerves are practically visible. As she talks, we PULL BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR.
No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you waiting `til Denver to tell her...? (as her smile contracts) Oh. I see... (silence; she clenches her jaw...) No, you're right. I understand. (...and a tear falls from her eye) Ok... I just... Oh... An ASSISTANT appears through the glass on the door behind Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. Can I come in?
(crying now) No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --
I wanted to give you an entrance.
Eh...
I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
I don't know if they were there. As Mia slips away --
Can't. Working.
(opening up) Yes?
It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses.
No...
I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I ---- but Sebastian just walks right by -- his shoulderbumping against Mia's for an added measure of disdain.He heads out the door. Slams it shut. Mia is left standing onher own. She looks like she's just been slapped.
I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. Did you test for achromatopsia?31 Then, a second audition --
D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights.32 And finally, a third audition --
This is my classroom. You don't like it, the door's to my left.
No, Jamal. You be trippin'.
(takes this in; then --) Congratulations. I have to grab a drink... Revision 17. She slips away. Presses toward the bar. The music gets louder, more obnoxious. She peers toward the band to get a look... And then she sees him. Sebastian. Playing keyboard-guitar for the band. Dressed up like his band- mates in a bright polyester outfit. And hating every second. The band finishes, and the SINGER addresses the (thin) crowd.
""I Ran"". Sebastian turns. Sees Mia, looking at him with a defiant grin, enjoying her power. He thinks -- then recognizes the face.
""Curt""?
Ok.
My God. Did you just call yourself ""a serious musician""?
Can I borrow what you're wearing?
Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter.
Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic.
He just told you what to do.
Mia.
(to Sebastian) George Michael! Sebastian stops. Looks at her. Surprised.
Did you just get your keys? Sebastian thinks. Sees the Valet. Playing it off --
Can you grab mine?
The Prius. A beat. Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. Motions to the Valet: Sorry. One second. Looks. All the keys are Prius keys.
The one with the green ribbon. Another beat. Sebastian finds it. Grabs it.
(almost tripping in her heels) Shit...
They are...n't. A beat. She aims again. No beep.
Thank you for saving the day back there.
Strange that we keep running into each other.
I doubt it.
What?Sebastian demonstrates with his fob. He looks idiotic.
Uh-huh.
Oh my God.Just then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINEAPPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as youcan see. It's the most romantic sight imaginable. They lookat each other. A beat. And then --
Eh.They walk on, the lights shimmering behind.
Agreed. I've seen better.And on that -- they SING. [A LOVELY NIGHT]Mia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of thissetting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alonetogether, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. It's""no big deal"", nothing they haven't seen or felt before --because, after all, there's no chance for romance betweenthem...Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggestsotherwise. Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishesfor flats in her handbag. Sebastian sits beside her as sheslips the flats on. They look at each other, suspicious... Revision 22.He moves his foot. She moves hers. They look at each otheragain. Still suspicious...He moves again. She moves again. They seem to be moving insync -- without their even wanting to...And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almostslipped into DANCE...Sebastian rises. Mia rises as well. The two look at eachother. Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lightsstretch out like a magic carpet. They share a moment -- sharea look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW...Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. Sebastian does a move, Miashakes her head: ""Nope"". They make the road their own, growingmore and more energized, as surprised as we are to find --...that they can really dance together.Just as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, realjoy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closerand closer, looking at each other almost giddily......a sound cuts through. It's a CELL PHONE ring.Mia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench.Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell.
Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon...She hangs up. Looks at Sebastian. An awkward silence. Finally --she presses her fob again. Puts it under her chin this time. ABEEP can be heard. They see her Prius.
Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride to your car?
...Ok...Not sure what else to say, she heads to her vehicle. Waves.
Night.Sebastian waves back. Mia drives off. Fast. Silence... Revision 23. Looking even more disappointed than he thought he'd be, Sebastian walks on for a bit -- then retreats back down.A37 Comes to a stop across from the party, and we see his Riviera -- right, it seems, where he knew it was all along. He pulls out his keys -- they don't have a clicker after all.
No...
I have an audition. Remember?
But you said --
...Hi. (then) What are you doing here?
Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?
I'm off in ten.
That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca. Sebastian nods. They start walking.
Yeah. Greg.
We've been seeing each other for a few months. An awkward beat. They pass a wooden SALOON -- where a WESTERN is being shot. Extras in COWBOY costumes drink coffee on the steps. Revision 25.
I love this stuff. Makes coming to work easier.
Oh yeah?
A what?
(to Sebastian) We need to wait here.
Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. (a beat; then,) I never knew the world was so big.
I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year.
God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying.C40 CUT TO: The entrance to a giant soundstage.
Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I've tried so hard to want other things. She and Sebastian stop. Peer inside the stage.
I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. (a beat; then, deadpan --) Should've been a lawyer. Revision 27. They resume walking.D40 CUT TO: A row of closed soundstages, sandy-tan against the bright blue sky.
Well it doesn't need more actresses.
What do you mean, ""just an actress""?
That is not what I said.
Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible.
Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. Sebastian laughs.
Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you...
I hate jazz. Sebastian stops. Turns to her.
It means when I listen to it I don't like it.
I do hate some animals.
I thought it was just Kenny G.
I associate it with facials. It's relaxing.
(laying it on thick) Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese.
Your club?
Hi, I just missed a call...
I got a call-back!
That show I told you about.
Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause.
Obviously. (a beat; then --) No.
It's the one I lie about.
(considering this) ...Ok. Revision 31.
Ok. (another nod, taking it in) For research. Mia looks at him -- he looks at her -- each of them suppressing a newfound giddiness... And on that --
Hi, Mom!
Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.
Well -- it's not picked up yet.
First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision 32.
Well, no, I have a call-back.
It's another audition.
...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment.
Oxygen.
You know what, I have to go. I love you. She hangs up. Takes a deep breath. Enters the building.
Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied --
I can do it another way --
Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...
I'm sorry. -- and -- as the sounds of a FULL ORCHESTRA swoop in -- -- RUNS out of the restaurant as fast as she can.
I have an idea.
It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.
Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show... A beat -- and then --
(glowing) I think so.
Nice meeting you. Keith walks off. Mia and Sebastian look at each other. Then --
...You're just saying that.
I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic?
But do you think people will like it?
(laughs) You always say that.
Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise.
I made something for you.She hops off the bed, fishes through a bag. Pulls out adrawing.
It could be the name design. On the door.
That's what you should name it.
Sebastian, no one's going to a club called ""Chicken on a Stick"".
No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. (he rolls his eyes) And it's time to start looking for other places.
Make your own history.Sebastian looks at her. Appreciates that line. A beat. Then --
I'm doing that.They laugh.
So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?
The one who offered you a gig.
Why was it weird between you two?
He did offer you a job.
Are you going to call him?
Ok...A moment passes. They lie down, side by side.
Thanks Harry, I'm good. Revision 52.
I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...A moment passes.
Nothing...
I guess. I'm adapting.
He told me.
Do you think he's happy?
I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. Revision 53. Laura shrugs.
Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you... (a beat) Ok... Bye... She hangs up. Resumes typing. Revision 54.
Stay. He smiles.
I'm nervous. Revision 55.
Because... (a beat) What if people show up?
I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified.
I can.A smile. Beat.
What time do you leave in the morning?
Ugh.
Boise?
To Boise? Revision 56.
Wish I could.A beat.
Come to Boise?
Because I have to rehearse.
You mean anywhere you are?
Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical...
I know, but when are you done?
When are you done with the tour? Revision 57.
So it's...the long haul?
I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time.
I don't know, I didn't think the band would --
No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now?
Do you like the music you're playing?
It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. Revision 58.
Yes. I do. (beat)I just didn't think you did.
And now I hear you're going to be on theroad for years, and I'm --
What do you mean why am I doing this?
To be in this band?
Yes, I wanted you to have a job so youcould take care of yourself and startyour club.
Why aren't you starting your club?
Change the name!
I do like jazz now, because of you.
People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about.
(trying again) You had a dream that you were sticking to, that --
This is not your dream.
Why do you care so much about being liked
Are you kidding?
Stop -- She pulls away. Steps back. Sebastian looks at her. Unmoored.
It's over. She doesn't say the words with any anger. Just acceptance.
I'm done embarrassing myself.
No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater. She says this as though just realizing it. Sebastian looks at her. A moment passes. He doesn't know what to say now.
I'm gonna go home for a while.
Not anymore. Sebastian is silent now. A tear in his eye. He clenches his jaw. Mia looks at him one more time, steps into her car, and drives off. Sebastian lingers. Doesn't move. Silence. Then, music. Soft, melancholy, just piano, as...
I'm ok.
I'm good... A moment. Mia's Dad puts a few more dishes away, then sits back down across from her.
You took down the swing.
Oh God. Throw those away.
Why did you come here?
Ok...
I know who she is.
I'm not going.
I'm -- no... That will kill me.
Yes. Revision 70.
I'm happier.
I told you.
(finally letting it out, fed up --) Because it's another audition! (a beat; then --) I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do you want to know what happens? Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I'm crying and they start laughing, or I'm one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- (beat) -- because --
Because I'm probably not good enough.
No. Maybe I'm not.A beat.
Maybe I'm one of those people who's always wanted to do it but never had a chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's like you said. Maybe I need to grow up.She hesitates. Continues -- Revision 71.
I can go back to school. I can find something else that I'm supposed to do. I left school to give it a shot, and it didn't work out, and it took six years, and I don't want to do it anymore. Beat. But Sebastian isn't giving up.
Why what?
...Because it hurts a little bit too much. Sebastian shakes his head. Nope. Won't accept this.
How did you find me? Sebastian turns. Points. Matter-of-fact --
...Ok.
...About...?
My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... (beat) I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once... She pauses, and then continues -- in SONG. [TRACK: AUDITION] Yes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch to song signals just that. Mia's nerves fade away -- all the accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. This is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful... She uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the people who are told they're nuts for pursuing their passion -- all the so-called ""fools"" who take the plunge. She sings about them and for them. This is why Mia does what she does -- why she simply has no choice... The song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. Then... Revision 74.
They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out.
No, I'm not.
Where are we? Sebastian looks at her.
I mean -- where are we?
What do we do?
If I get this -- Revision 75.
What are you going to do?
Right.Another moment. And then, finally --
You know I'm always going to love you.
(playfully) I've seen better. Revision 76.
I've never been here during the day. Sebastian smiles. A moment. We CUT TO WIDE. Sebastian and Mia sit side by side. We linger here, our two characters framed by the white-and-green Observatory, the rest of L.A. stretching out beyond. And then, ever so slowly... ...we FADE TO:
Hi... Iced coffee, please. MIA looks different. Different haircut, different way of handling herself. The BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. We recognize this as the shop where Mia used to work. A man who appears to be the NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee -- Revision 77.
No, no, that's fine. Mia hands over a few dollar bills. Then drops another bill into the tip jar. The Barista smiles.
Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea. The Girl nods. Mia kisses her forehead. Heads to the door.
We can just see it back in New York... David nods. Looks at the time on the car. 8:06.
Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off here and get dinner? David looks at her. Smiles.
I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- -- but instead of brushing past her -- -- Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages. A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in time. Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin -- and then strut out together, hand in hand... [EPILOGUE]
No... We should go. He nods. They rise from their seats and head for the exit. Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia turns and looks back at Sebastian. He looks at her. Their eyes lock. A hint of a tear in both... And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles. It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still thinks of it to this day... Then she walks out the door. Sebastian glances at his fellow musicians. Then, he nods, and they launch into a new chart.
","You gotta stop breaking into my home. She looks up. She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like she doesn't care. This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister.
Please don't sit on that.
Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.
Don't need it.
That's almost insulting... (then,) Did he? Revision 11.She shakes her head: Unbelievable. Tosses the rug to the side.
When I unpack them in my club.
No.A beat. Then --
They've turned it into a tapas-samba place. You believe that?
Who wants to tapas while they samba?
I don't want to meet anyone.
Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?
Then what are we gonna talk about?
Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. Revision 12.
How long's it been?
I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed.
What's the difference?
Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word?
You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.Laura can't help but laugh. Stops by the door. Looks at him.
I'm changing the locks. Revision 13.
I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes! No reply to his triumphant declaration. He shuts the door. Looks again at the napkin. Thinks. Tosses it in the trash.
(putting on a smile) Bill. Thanks for having me back.
Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play.
How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me? (the Boss just glares) Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal. Sebastian sits down at the keys. A WAITRESS passes by.
There's a nice way to say that. With that -- he starts playing ""Jingle Bells"".
I'll stick to the set list, I promise --
You're not gonna find a better player. You know that.
Ok. I remember you. Mia looks at him. One eyebrow raised. Yeah?
And I'm sorry if I was curt that night.
Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that. Revision 18.
But requesting ""I Ran"" from a serious musician -- it's too far.
(beat) I don't think so.
Why?
(irritation building --) So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything?
Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there.
He doesn't tell me what to do.
I let him. Revision 19. A beat.
What's your name?
Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies. He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes:
You again.
...Yeah. Revision 20.
...Which one is it?
Those look comfortable.
You didn't give me much of a choice.
It is strange. Maybe it means something.
Yeah I don't think so either. Revision 21.On that, Mia aims again. As always -- no beep. Noticing --
Put the clicker under your chin.
It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly.
You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out.
Not much to look at.
No, that's fine... Thanks...
Meetings. Studio heads. Revision 24.
Piece of cake. Mia looks at him. He's sweating through his shirt. A beat.
Actually it took me four hours and I ended up running. We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. You got a break coming up? Mia laughs. A moment.
Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.
What's your Bogart's name...? (Mia looks at him) Is it Greg?
How long have...?
I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club.
It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb. (then,) It's a samba-tapas place now.
Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history.Mia laughs.
Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything and they value nothing.They reach a patch of green. Another shoot. A P.A. yells out:
I know. They shoot movies on my street. ""C-stands."" ""Apple box."" ""Don't forget to sign out.""Mia laughs. A beat.
How'd you get into all this? Revision 26.
Who would you invite to watch? Your parents?
...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.
You're not just an actress.
You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright.
You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are.
All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history.
Yeah? Revision 28.
What does that mean? ""I hate jazz""?
But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying ""I hate animals"".
Do you need to be anywhere right now? Mia looks at him. We hear DRUMS. A swinging ride pattern. And we're in --
Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. They don't get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other.
...What? Mia looks at him. Already knows just how to get to him.
It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision 29.
Mia. These are things you can't unsay.She bursts into laughter. Sebastian points to the band --
It's not cocktail music -- it's a high- wire act. These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once.A beat. Mia looks at the band. We DRIFT over the instruments...
That's why you need to be in the space and see what's at stake. This whole thing -- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages `cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they'll play whatever they want.Mia looks at Sebastian. Her laughter has subsided. She cansee something in him now -- the same passion he's speaking of...
...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.He watches the band. Lost in the sound. Then -- sincere --
The world tells everyone to move on. Says the music's had its moment. But I love it too much. I'm not moving on.The band finishes. The ride cymbal sizzles in the air...
So?He looks at Mia. She's visibly moved.Just then -- we hear a BEEP. Mia looks at her phone. Revision 30.
Really? For what?
Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?
That's amazing! ""I got the bulletsssss!"" Mia laughs. But Sebastian can tell something in her laugh...
You've seen it, right?
What? You're the movie person.
Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research.
10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?
Keith? Revision 41.
This is Mia. Mia, Keith. (explaining to Mia) We used to play together.
Great. You?
Good for you.
(after a beat) I'm good.
I'm good.Keith almost smiles. Expected this.
You bet.
It's beautiful.
No... I'm not. We PULL BACK -- and see a script on Mia's lap. She's just finished reading Sebastian her play.
That's the point.
Fuck `em.
I truly believe it.
I'll be front-row. Mia looks at him. Smiles. It genuinely means the world to her. Then, a glow in her eyes, wants to reciprocate -- Revision 43.
What's that?
Why does it say ""Seb's""?
Never.
You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name ""Bird"" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. ""Chicken on a Stick"".
It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history.
Your play's incredible.Mia smiles. He approaches her, sits by her side.
The whole world from your bedroom? Who's doing that? Revision 44.
...Which guy?
You mean Keith? He's the worst.
It's always weird with him.
Right...
No.A beat.
Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- (Mia rolls her eyes) -- and your play is going to be a triumph.She looks at him. He looks at her. A shared smile.And on that -- Revision 45.
(a bit awkward) Well... Here I am. A moment. Then --
Where's the piano? Keith gestures -- to an electronic keyboard. Sebastian winces. Revision 46.
Yeah, that...that... (beat) ...sounds good. A moment. Keith smiles.
You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future. A moment. Then --
Surprise. She lights up. He lifts up silver serving trays, revealing what he's cooked. Roast chicken. Pasta.
And... (he hurries to the kitchen -- and holds up a big apple pie) There's twenty-five pounds of apples in it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem but it tastes good. Mia laughs. Can't believe it. Sebastian looks at her -- sincere now.
I have to head back in the morning but I needed to see you. Mia's eyes seem almost on the brink of tears. Beyond moved, she runs into Sebastian's arms. A LONG, HEARTFELT KISS...
Feels so good to be home.
How's the play going?
Why?
Fuck `em!Laughter. Then --
You're nervous about what they think?
They should be so lucky to see it. (then,) It's going to be incredible. I can't wait.
Yep. Boise.
(nods) You should come.
Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list.Mia laughs.
Why can't you?
Yeah.
Can't you rehearse anywhere?She looks at him.
...I -- I guess...
Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other.
...What do you mean?
But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour.Mia looks at him. Doesn't seem to understand.
We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record.Beat. Mia takes this in.
...What does that mean?
What did you think I was going to do?
You didn't think we'd be successful.
Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record.Beat.
I don't know how that matters.
Do you like the music I'm playing?
Yeah, well, I --
What are you doing? Why are you doingthis?
This is what you wanted from me.
To have a steady job.
So I'm doing that. So why aren't wecelebrating?
You said yourself no one wants to go tothat club! No one wants to go to a clubcalled Chicken on a Stick --
-- and no one likes jazz. Not even you. Revision 59.
(not listening to her) What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing ""Jingle Bells"" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to?
Not in my experience.A beat. Mia realizes she's getting nowhere. A moment ofquiet. Then --
Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know? This is what I'm doing. If you had a problem, I wish you would've said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line.
This is the dream!
Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that?
(finally bursting--) You're an actress, who are you to talk??Silence. We suddenly realize -- Revision 60. -- the LP has finished. You can hear the needle scratch against it now -- back and forth, back and forth. Sebastian looks at Mia. A moment. Finally --
Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself. Mia looks back at him. Can't believe he said that. Tears starting to well in her eyes. She tries to suppress them.
No. They stare at each other. Then -- all of a sudden -- the FIRE ALARM blares. Sebastian turns and sees smoke billowing from the KITCHEN. A dish in the oven has started to burn. Sebastian rises, springs toward the kitchen -- then sees Mia grabbing her things.
Wait -- But she's out the door. It slams shut, as Sebastian pulls the burnt apple pie from the oven. And on that -- WE SMASH CUT TO --
...Tonight?
I thought that was next Thursday.
Mia! She turns. Sees him. He runs to her. WRAPS his arms around --
I'm sorry -- -- and KISSES her. The kind of kiss that might once have swept her off her feet. He starts to move with her... ...starts to DANCE -- but --
I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you --
(a beat; then --) ...What do you mean?
You didn't embarrass yourself... Revision 65.
...This is home.
Oh God, I didn't see them.
You look beautiful. (beat) I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.
Yes ma'am.
...You still think New York?
What...?
Wrong number.
Yeah, well...not anymore.
I won't.
""Casting""...? Revision 68.
Because I have good news.
Amy Brandt. The casting director.
She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got. He's brimming over with excitement. But Mia just shakes her head.
...Excuse me?
That's it?
So you're happy here?
Why won't you come?
I don't buy it.
Because what?
Yes you are.
Why?
Why don't you want to do it anymore? Mia thinks about this one for a moment.
I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you'll be outside or you won't. With that, he gets back into his car. Mia is silent. Then --
The house across from the library. He drives off. Mia looks up. There, sure enough, is the LIBRARY, crouched on the corner. The library that once helped set her on her path to acting. She looks at it. Thinks...
When do you find out?
You're going to get it.
You are. I know these things. A beat.
Griffith Park.
I know... (beat) I don't know.
I don't think we can do anything. Because when you get this --
When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got.Beat.
It's your dream.
I've got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know...A moment. Mia nods. Sebastian looks at her again.
You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz there. And you love jazz now.Mia smiles.
Right?
I guess we're just going to have to wait and see.Mia's eyes well up, just slightly, as she hears this. Shenods.
I'm always going to love you too.Beat. Sebastian looks up at the Observatory.
Look at this view.
Agreed. They laugh. Then, almost to herself --
Alright, I'm done. (gets up) Harris did a nice job with it.
No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels.
How'd we do last month?
(as he signs the check) Not too bad is great. (taps the Employee on the shoulder) See you tonight.
Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?
Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?
(taking the microphone) Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. (more applause) I don't know, I told him to play ""Jingle Bells"". The crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them -- -- and sees Mia. Shock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first time they've seen each other in years. A prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless. Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face --
Welcome to Seb's. More applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys. He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys -- -- and finally starts playing. Revision 82. A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize... It's Mia and Sebastian's song. Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys. This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded. We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon...144 ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... Back when Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time... Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece. We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and --
","You think Mom or Dad would call this a home? Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool --
Are you serious?
I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. It's a throw rug.
Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it?
When are you going to unpack these boxes?
Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her. (then, looks at him --) You're not still going by there, are you?
Seb --
I have someone I want you to meet.
You'll like her.
Probably not.
You'll talk about the weather.
Sebastian --
You need to get serious. You live like a hermit. You're driving without insurance.
You did not get ""Shanghai'ed"", you got ripped off.
It's not as romantic as that. (she starts to walk off) And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you.
Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.She heads to the door. He follows her, won't give it up --
I love you. Unpack your boxes.
(out the door with a smile --) You can't afford it. She's gone. Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out --
Look at him -- watch -- Mia glances out the window. A MAN in his early 40's has just parked, is walking around his car, inspecting it.
Now he's going to check the other window. Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check again. Yep, still closed. Mia smiles. The MAN enters the restaurant -- greets Mia -- and kisses Laura. This is HARRY. Her new boyfriend.
Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car.Harry rolls his eyes, heads to the front. Laura looks at Mia.
Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now?
You should come over tonight. Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you. (Mia manages a smile; a beat) What's the matter?
You miss him.
(nods; then,) I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other.
I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... (Mia smiles) You've changed Seb. You know that?Laura means it positively -- but Mia seems concerned...
Is he happy?
Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. (a beat) So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I'm happy for him. She notices Harry through the window, returning. Her thoughts drift.
Dreams change. A beat. She looks back at Mia. Sees her worry.
Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon. Harry rejoins the table. Hands Laura a sponge cake.
I told you not to get me anything!
No -- I changed my mind. They laugh. Kiss. Tender. Loving. Mia watches...
You remember the McKenzies?
Yeah. They kept going, ""oh Sebastian's so handsome"". Sebastian smiles. Then --
You were great (pause) You're always great when you play. Sebastian is silent. Then --
Now -- listen to me. I want you to save for a down payment. You understand? You need a home.
I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.
I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know, it's exciting... Sebastian smiles again. Some calls from the distance -- Revision 67.
Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws... She lights up. Likes the sound of that.
Is my...my hair...? Sebastian, without a word, pulls a strand back. Laura smiles, kisses him on the cheek. A quiet, tender moment. Then she hurries off. Sebastian stands there. Watches...
","Holy shit. Come here, man.Sebastian gets up. Gives him a hug. But Mia can sense anunease in Sebastian's eyes. It's a strained hug.
So how've you been?
Keeping busy. Got a new combo.
...Looking for keys.
You sure? It pays.Sebastian looks at Keith. A moment.
Let's just grab a drink then. Call me. It's been too long.
Nice meeting you, Mia. Revision 42.
Sebastian. Sebastian approaches.
Didn't know if I'd see you today.
Here's the deal. We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. We're about to go on the road. We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good? We see Sebastian's face. Taken aback.
Sebastian?
Let's play, see how it feels. He pulls out a guitar. Cole starts on drums. Keith joins in. Malcolm and Tom follow suit. Sebastian listens. It sounds like modern jazz -- electronic in feel, but still jazz... Sebastian approaches the keyboard. Joins -- slowly, one step at a time. Then begins playing out a bit more, his fingers starting to race. Malcolm gives Keith a look: ""Damn"". Keith gives Malcolm a look back: ""I told you so."" Bit by bit, Sebastian eases into the groove. This isn't so bad... Then -- Keith moves to a LAPTOP. Introduces a DRUM-MACHINE
I know. It's different. Sebastian stays silent. Then, leaning in --
But you say you want to save jazz. How are you going to save jazz if no one's listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people hadn't gotten tired of what they were listening to before. (then,) I mean, do you really think a bunch of ninety-year-olds in a basement is the future of the form? Traditionalists whined when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs. If traditionalists had their way, we'd still be playing Dixieland. Sebastian considers this. As much as he might make a play of resisting -- we can tell the words are getting to him...
I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't as good as you. But you're a pain in the ass, man. Sebastian nods. Knows he can't argue with that. Another beat.
If it's not your thing, just let me know. I don't want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it's not. But if you want it -- the job's yours. Sebastian looks at Keith. A moment. He's really weighing this. And on that -- his look of uncertainty -- we're --
You good for tonight, right? Sebastian stops. Looks at Keith.
Seven. The photo shoot. (reading Sebastian's face, adding --) Mojo. A beat. Sebastian is confused.
No. It's tonight. We linger on Sebastian for a moment...
Is that ok?
","Holy Mother of God. Mia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27.
Ever heard of a vent?
Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom --
Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming.C8 With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet --
It'll be fun.
Exactly. Fun. She pulls out a blue dress. As Alexis hurries in --
(faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest. Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that -- Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD] She play-acts the clichés this party will represent. Alexis and Caitlin join in, giddy and playful. Mia can't help but laugh. The roommates sing and dance, hoping to persuade Mia to join the night's revelry... Mia remains reluctant. Stays behind in her room as her roommates head out the door. But she's starting to wonder: A night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out with her friends...?
There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer.
Is that a script?
...Is that gonna happen every time?
