txt,"That's all he said?
Turn left or right? The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director answers her in a long excited phrase.
Is that everything? It seemed like he was saying a lot more. The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on.
For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time. The Director yells something about ten sentences long. The translator nods.
Okay. The Translator answers for him in four sentences. ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line.
For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time.
Yes?
Oh?
Yes?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Huh? She pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands.
Oh, you want me to rip them? He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just snap. She pretends to struggle.
I think you should leave.
I'll have to see about that.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Yeah, they told me.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye. He hangs up. The make-up artist dusts him with powder. The commercial people are crowding around. Bob's chair is swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner. In front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory. small documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera- the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty dutch camera moves. The agency people crowd around. The photographer is excited and urges Bob to do dumb poses, he won't do.
Urn, I don't think so. How bout I just hold the bottle. The photographer starts shooting. Bob obviously hates the whole thing, what you do for money.
(everything's fine) Good morning. Miss Kawasaki notices his limp with concern as they leave the hotel.
(line from commercial) For relaxing times, make itÂ—
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays. Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial. She looks at him.
What about you? Why are you here?
How long have you been married?
Try twenty-five.
I'm thinking about it.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois, and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
What do you do?
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks. They clink glasses.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet? Charlotte laughs with sympathy, but doesn't know what to tell him.
(awkward, but glad to run into her) Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
No, how about you?
I'm here for the week.
Ok.
(embarrassed) I know, it's stupid. He goes into the bathroom to change it. He comes out with it on inside out so it's just an orange T-shirt. He asks her to cut the label out for him. She goes to find some scissors. He picks up A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling audio-book box.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
I read it, too. She smiles, busted, but doesn't say anything as she cuts his shirt label with little hotel sewing-kit scissors. She slips on her shoes on to leave.
Hi, Charlie. They shake hands.
No way.
Ok.
I will. Bob takes Charlotte's arm carefully just as she bangs her head walking into the glass door - it makes a loud thud.
Are you ok? She nods. Bob looks back at Charlie who is watching- she's fine. He leads her into a waiting cab.
I know. I don't either.
Lydia?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Yeah, its really different here.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
(grumbly) Hello?
Charlotte, who?
I see them every morning. They don't know what to say. Somehow it's too intimate having breakfast. She eats her breakfast aware of her every movement. C.U. - her POV of soft scrambled eggs.
Hans was very attentive to you.
No, its easy.
I don't know.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember? She shrugs.
No, you smiled.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
No, yes, it does...
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
That's ok.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We established that we have no communication.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Where'd you grow up?
I know.
You are.
Because that would be too easy. They fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite sides of the bed.
Hello?
Ok.
(sarcastic) Great.
Miss Kawasaki? It's Bob Harris... I'm not going to be able to do that interview today.., yeah... ok.... Yes, I'd love to stay to be on his talk show... sure.. ok... bye. A light rain starts as he looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map she's drawn and tries to figure out where he is - there are no street signs.
They really have to work on that street name thing. A perky recording voice says ""Kornichiwa!"" from his pocket.
It's for my daughter.
Four.
Nice one.
What happened to your toe?
That doesn't look good. She enjoys the sympathy.
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah, look at that thing. She smiles at him.
How do you say ""hospital"" in Japanese?
Hospital?
Yes, can you tell me how to say ""hospital"" in Japanese?
Hosupitari? He tells the Driver who looks at him funny. Bob says it again- faster, with a Japanese accent. The driver nods excitedly and drives off.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
Yeah, I'll stay.
Hello?
Hi, Lydia.
Uh, no.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
You know, eat healthier.
Not all that pasta.
Like Japanese food.
Oh, come on.
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
Where's your husband?
Do you ever see him?
Do you know where we are?
(nodding) I enjoy the sport. The Translator translates - four sentences longer and with added enthusiasm. After a few questions the Host excitedly announces something to the AUDIENCE in Japanese. They scream, the lights flash, Bob has no idea what's going on. A cloud of smoke reveals the IRON CHEF, with feathered hair, wearing an 18th century waistcoat. A large red chef hat is placed on Bob's head.
Yes, but no, I can't right now. The singer starts singing again in the background. Charlotte gives Bob a look.
I don't want to be. He watches Charlotte walk away down the beige hall.
Hello?
(can't hear) Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's ok.
What?
Yeah.
That's ok.
Tomorrow.
Ok. In the background the daughter calls for her Mommy over and over and a dog starts barking.
Bye.
No, we'll find something around here. She goes with him.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention? She scowls at him. The waitress brings them drinks- she pours beer slowly, and turns on a pot on the table to cook their food. Charlotte looks at the menu - it is filled with photos of different trays of meat. The waitress doesn't speak English.
We'll have two of these. He makes some small talk, she is bugged.
What do you want to drink?
So, where'd you go today.
I'm sorry.
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Why can't it last?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Uh...Hi, Charlotte... it's me, Bob... ok, I guess you're not there... wanted to say good-bye... He hangs up, feeling lame.
Charlotte?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
That'd be great.
0hr hi.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going. He sees Charlotte come out of the elevator.
I have to go, thanks, bye. He rushes over to Charlotte. She looks at his bag.
Yes, no. She hands him his jacket.
Thanks. She waits for him to say something more. He wants to tell her he loves her, that she should come with him.
Yes.
Thanks.
Can you pull over a second? The DRIVER, wearing white cloth gloves, pulls the car over slowly. Bob tries to open the door'99 it won't open, he has to wait for the automatic doors to open for him (slowly).
Why are you crying?
I know, I'm going to miss you, too. He holds her close.
","Are you awake? He doesn't answer.
John? He grumbles something, opens one sleepy eye to look at her, and grabs her under the covers. He kisses her.
I'm not sure.
What are you doing here?
Oh. She lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her.
I'll just have a beer. He makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Two years.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
(amused with too much info) Oh.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Evelyn Waugh?
Evelyn Waugh was a man. John shrugs.
Why do you have to defend her?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it. His producer comes up to them. John puts his arm around Charlotte, kisses her, everything's fine.
How'd it go today?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Sure.
(she's never heard of that) Really? John shoots Charlotte a look.
Yeah, it is. DJ Clean starts doing a human beat box at her. Charlotte looks over at Kelly.
Hi again, how's it going?
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
I don't know what to do.
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
Hair stuff?
Bye.
Lauren?
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ... and John's using hair products... I don't know who
Sure. Charlotte waits.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Ok, bye. She hangs up. She sits there for a moment, starting to cry, she wipes the tears, trying to make them go away.
Ouch. She holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness. John talks to her from the shower.
Yeah.
Do you think it's done?
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Ok, I will... later. He picks up a camera from a table in the corner. He looks at the self-help audio book box.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Are you sure you have to go? He looks at her - like don't make it harder.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
I love you. He tackles her, kisses her, bites her, grabs her ribs, tickling her in a burst of affection. She laughs, her arms around his neck.
I miss you.
Oh, hi.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
See you later. He watches her go.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
No. She returns with the hotel room sewing kit.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob Â— Charlie Brown.
His real name's Hayashi, but someone started calling him Charlie because they thought he looked like Charlie Brown. They've all got American nicknames because its easier for me to remember... they were just out in L.A. last month doing a shoot with John... that guy's Mr.Valentine, he's the art director of their magazine, I don't even know his real name, or why I call him that. Bob looks over at some SKINNY GUY in huge glasses smiling at them. Charlie hands them some drinks.
Hi. A young SHY GUY with a shaved head smiles at her, and takes her picture. A JAPANESE KRAFTWERK COVER-BAND plays Trans Europa Express. Some people at the bar buy drinks for Bob and insist on drinking with him. Bob and Charlotte look over as Charlie gets into some problem with the BARTENDER. The Bartender gets mad and starts shooting a real-looking BB gun at him. Orange bullets fly through the air. They all rush out of there.
(smiles) Good.
Thanks, you guys should come back sometime.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
You bite your nails? He nods.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Hans? Nice to meet you.
I don't want to go home.
Do you want to have some breakfast? C.U. her hand wraps the phone cord around her fingers.
OK, see you downstairs.
(trying to make it light) Hey look, it's Sausalito.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
I don't remember.
Yeah? But look at you.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
But, I'm mean.
And marriage, does that get easier?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Oh.
That's too scary.
(getting tired) No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there. They are starting to get tired.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know, but that's what you like about me. She looks over at him. He does like her.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
You made it.
What's that? He pulls a pink Hello Kitty watch from his pocket.
How old is she?
Oh, she'll love it. The Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a banana leaf. Charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. Bob makes fun of her gracelessness.
(mouth full) Fuck off. They have lunch, he makes her laugh. He looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day... She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe is black and blue.
It's bad isn't it?
You think so?
Is that for me?
How long have you been here? He looks at her like it's been forever. She smiles for forgiveness. They look over and see a WEIRD GUY in the corner getting a lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it. Through a beaded curtain, Charlie and Bambi get lap dances in a dark corner of pillows. Charlotte looks at Bob.
C'mon, let's go.
(like she's said it a million times) Working.
(sorta) Yeah.
No. She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake ""one-cup"". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee.
Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs... They keep walking, small figures on a little empty street.
Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? I'm not sure...I'm going to go to Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you when I get back. Hope it's going good... I love you, bye.
Rough night? He's not in the mood, he looks at her like he already hates himself, doesn't need more help.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
The Jazz singer? The red-head? Bob looks at her like- don't make it worse.
Well, I guess she's more around your age... You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
I can't tell the difference? They have trouble ordering, but point to a picture on the menu.
A coke. He orders the drinks.
Around. ""This is the End"" by The Doors starts playing on the stereo. The waitress brings two huge trays of sliced raw beef. Steam rises from the pot on the table. The song ends, and another Doors song comes on.
They're not going to play the whole album, are they? They look across the table, over the steam and meat, at each other- the whole thing is awful.
That lunch was the worst, huh. He laughs. She looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel slippers.
When are you leaving?
(friendly) I'm going to miss you.
Well, I mean it more now.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band. (alt Charlotte dialog: I don't know it just doesn't, reality changes things...and we can't stay here forever) He looks over at her. The singer continues Where or When, as they sit there together, the view sparkling.
Hi, Bob.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
That's it? The concierge tells him his car is here.
You're leaving right now?
Well... have a good flight.
(hurt) Ok, bye. She walks away. A hotel manager asks Bob about his luggage, another asks if he had a pleasant stay. Charlotte gets in the elevator to go out, the doors close on her back.
(sincere) I'll miss you. He kisses her, hugs her good-bye.
","Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Can I enter? He pauses, then opens the door. A WOMAN in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt and stockings comes in. She is wearing '60s style make-up. Bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her. Bob's POV - We see her back to us as she puts a CD on the stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte Bardot sing ""Bonnie & Clyde"". The woman turns slyly around and shimmies over to Bob.
(as she tries to undress him) Mr. Harris?
Do you like massage?
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy. She pushes him back onto the bed. He hesitates, but then goes along with it passively.
My stockings.
Take them. He fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says.
No - Lip them... Don't touch me! He takes his hands back confused.
Lip my stockings! He backs away, as he tries to understand her.
Lip them! She throws her leg up to him on the bed.
Please let me go! He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake- defense.
Let me go! She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know what she wants. She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to the floor, the room goes black.
","John! What are you doing here?
Promoting that action movie I did... She does a karate chop and laughs.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
It's amazing there!
No! Hi! So great to meet you!
You know, John, you're my favorite photographer, I only want to be shot by you. Charlotte looks at John.
(as she fans out her top) Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours... Kelly, giggling and acting all too comfortable with herself, is eating up all the oxygen around them.
(with a big smile) ...Well, I have the worst headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh. Kelly giggles. Charlotte smirks.
It was great. I've known him for a while now- you know we both live in L.A. We both have dogs... Charlotte walks out.
...My Dad was anorexic.
(very serious) He was on the American side at the Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was taken prisoner, and they tortured them about their food the whole time.
My dad fought on the American side at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up... and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have really clean food. And really simple. He can't just go have, say, Chinese food.
...Oh my god you have to try it, this power cleanse is amazing- it's lemon juice and grade B maple syrup and cayenne pepper for seven days. Just like a half a teaspoon of cayenne. The first few days you're a little scattered, but by day four - it's amazing... my eyes were so white... Charlotte excuses herself. She passes Bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar, as she is leaving.
","Go to sleep. He holds her close, but she can't sleep.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Uh..thanks.
Oh no...
Ok, see you later. And Kelly and her make-up artist and publicist are off. John and Charlotte continue.
What?
Oh, c'mon, she's nice. Not everyone went to Yale. Charlotte shoots him a look.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
OK, I'll see you later. He kisses her on the cheek, and is gone.
Good...I'm tired. He hugs her for a moment, leaning on her.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You wanna come?
(doesn't really want her to) Ok.
(trying) Oh, that's too bad. Charlotte ashes her cigarette in a clean ashtray, and she watches as it is quickly replaced with a new one by a WAITER.
No, what are you talking about.
That's ok. He looks for his mobile phone.
That's ok, you'll figure it out. He comes close and kisses her.
What? She leans back to look at him.
I got some hair stuff. She looks at him funny.
I gotta go to work. He grabs her, kissing her good-bye, she wraps her him, when his cell phone rings.
I'll be right down...I'm just leaving...ok. He kisses her, and leaves.
See you later.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to... He gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go. Charlotte's lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear. She tries her scarf on that she's been knitting.
I don't know. He goes to get all his stuff together. He passes an ashtray with cigarette butts in it.
Will you please stop smoking?
Its bad for you.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
You don't have to be embarrassed.
It's ok if you are. He kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute pet, and then continues getting his stuff together. John sets two bottles of Cristal on the bed next to her, not really seeing her.
Oh, the record company sent these...
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne. As he unplugs his cell phone from the wall.
Are you sure you want to stay?
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you. They kiss.
It'll just be a few days. He kisses her and is off. Charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of champagne.
