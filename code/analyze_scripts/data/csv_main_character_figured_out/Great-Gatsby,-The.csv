txt,"When I came back from New York I was disgusted. REVEAL: NICK CARRAWAY (37), unshaven, morbidly alcoholic.
Disgusted... with everyone, and everything... Only one man was exempt from my disgust. REVEAL: A kind, elderly DOCTOR.
He was... the single most hopeful person I have ever met... And am ever likely to meet again. There was something about him... Nick wanders slowly towards the window, remembering.
A sensitivity. He was like one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away...
At a party. In New York.
Gatsby. The Doctor concludes:
My neighbor? No, Gatsby was-- Well-- If I think about it... The history of the summer really began the night I drove over to my cousin Daisy's for dinner...
Oh, I'm selling bonds now Tom... with Walter Chase's outfit--
Big day on the new job tomorrow--
Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love.
They're absolutely in mourning... They're crying...
They're wailing...
They're screaming, they're shouting...
""Daisy Buchanan, we can't live without you!""
I've seen your face on the cover of ""Sporting Life"". Nick Carraway... But Jordan merely yawns and stands (we get a good look).
Well, my little shack is cardboard box at eighty a month.
I don't know a single-- Jordan turns dramatically.
Its a libel, I'm too poor.
Can't we talk about something else? Anything? Crops? You're making me feel uncivilized Daisy-- This draws a strangely violent interjection from Tom.
Why no... Tom stands and begins to pace--
Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor...
Is something happening?
I don't.
Got some woman?
I'm not even faintly like a rose--
I have to work early.
What?
Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything?
The green light.
I don't want to talk about this Doctor. Nick breaks off; and after a VERY LONG SILENCE, he admits:
I can't talk about THIS.
Why would I do that?
Yeah, well. It didn't bring anyone else much solace... I wasn't any good. The Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept.
What would I write about?
Wait a second would you!?
Oh no, that's alright, I'm busy...
Really I can't...
Oh, I'm... I'm not sure now's a good time-- I was just going-- But Nick's exit is blocked.
Nick Carraway.
(making for the door) Tom, I really should be going...
Tom; I don't think-- Daisy's my-- Tom pulls Nick back toward the party.
No...
Ah, no, well, I write a little... Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine raises her voice above the music.
I live at West Egg.
I live right next door to him...
Doesn't she like Wilson either?
My nerves are fine thanks... Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and suddenly kisses Nick... He splutters, but Catherine tips the scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down.
I have no clue how I got home.
Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me...
Because I got an invitation... I was the only one. FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick's doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation...
No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby's... The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: ""Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party...""
(to the bartender) Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby? He brandishes his invitation.
I live just next door...
Wow. As, unbeknownst to him, a mysterious, masked guest stalks toward him from behind...
Hello.
Its like... an amusement park.
Did you get an invitation?
Well I was... I seem to be the only one. Who is this Gatsby? A haughty East Egger, TEDDY, interjects...
You don't believe he killed a man do you...?
(slowly to Owl Eyes) But if that's true; what's all this for...?
I didn't expect all this...
I don't know...
Not in the slightest... Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss...
Yes; The Ninth Battalion. CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty.
What time?
I expected him to be...
Well, yes; young men don't just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island.
Why not?
What makes sense...?
But...
Good night. Thank you. Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside. As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch. SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly...
My... opinion?
Europe? Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands...
I'm sure that's not necessary... Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity.
A big request?
(caught off guard) Jordan...? What's she got to do with it?
One of your old Oxford pals?
By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused... Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR. An orchestral melody surges...
Really?
It's fine, thank you.
I've heard of it...
I'm not... married.
Oh, yes... We were just talking about other people's wives...
Who is he anyhow?
An actor?
Fixed it?
How did he manage that?
This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand.
I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats-- Nick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone. PUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger...
I'm looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer... There... I've spotted her. Nick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan.
What game are you and Gatsby playing at!? An immaculate MAITRE'D offers Nick a chair.
It's all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he's going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is--
What is this big request!?
Tea? (not what Nick expected) Daisy...? And Gatsby...? Nick sits...
Why?
It's a strange coincidence, isn't it? Gatsby's house being just across the bay... Jordan whirls round--
All that for a girl he hasn't seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...?
And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby?
Your place looks like the World's Fair... or Coney Island!
It's too late tonight.
I must go to bed... Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery.
Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea.
What day would suit you?
Day after tomorrow alright?
Not really.
Trying to.
I've got my hands full. Gatsby's face falls.
No, no, no... Its a favor Jay. Just a favor. Nick's sincerity disarms Gatsby; a tiny, embarrassed nod.
Happy to do it.
Yes. As if no one has ever done him a favor before in his life...
Goodnight. With this, Gatsby turns and strolls back toward his blazing castle. Nick's gaze falls upon the unkempt lawn. He smiles.
The grass looks fine.
Perhaps more flowers?
Beautiful.
I think it's what you want.
I am. With this, Gatsby straightens his suit, sits, and hurriedly checks his watch. Another long silence... PUSH IN ON: Gatsby... SUDDENLY! He leaps to his feet!
Don't be silly. It's just two minutes to four... But Gatsby heads for the door...
It's her. PUSH IN ON GATSBY: Mind racing...
That's the secret of Carraway Castle.
That's funny.
One moment...
What are you doing? Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into...
I just need to... pop into town.
The village; I'll be right back. As Nick leaves, Gatsby follows.
You're just embarrassed, that's all... Daisy's embarrassed too.
Just as much as you are.
You're acting like a little boy! You're rude. Daisy's in there all alone and... Gatsby raises his hand, looks at Nick reproachfully, and heads back into the living room.
Its... stopped raining. Daisy turns; a radiant smile. Every vestige of embarrassment between Daisy and Gatsby is gone. Gatsby literally glows.
Are you sure you want me to come?
Who's this? Your father?
You see doctor... Gatsby's real name was... James Gatz.
He rowed out and rescued the vessel, and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody... The bleary face of DAN CODY appears at the yacht's railing.
Just next door.
What about? Daisy glides toward him...
Well, its Tom. He's wandering around the party looking for you. Daisy flashes Gatsby an over-the-shoulder glance; when, suddenly, Herzog appears and murmurs...
But Gatsby was unable to return. As Daisy and Nick cross the tattered, streamer-littered dance- floor CRANE HIGH AND FADE INTO: the library window...
Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time... Gatsby is not amused.
Of course she did.
You mean about the party?
What...?
I wouldn't ask too much of her...
No. Gatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself.
Jay... You can't repeat the past. Gatsby wheels around...
No.
Laughter... No... No... Among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars...
(that's the one) But after Tom and Daisy visit...
There aren't any more.
What?
No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I'm thirty. Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink...
No thanks. I'll wait outside. Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain.
No... thanks.
No. I think I've had enough... Of everyone. CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside...
What are you doing!?
Yes, I can see that.
Trouble!? That woman you ran down is dead Jay!
Daisy? Do you hear yourself--
What's wrong with you!? How could you!?
Tom was right! You're nothing but a goddamn coward!
Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped her open! Panicked, Gatsby grabs Nick, trying to explain...
She? SUDDENLY! The CREAK of a door opening. A shaft of light... Henri emerges. AN INTERMINABLE moment. Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths. Finally, Henri goes back in. CLOSE ON: Nick, a realization.
It was Daisy? Finally, and very slowly, Gatsby admits.
Jay-- You shouldn't be here. You should get out of here. Gatsby gazes back to the house...
Tom won't touch her. He's not even thinking about her...
Alright. Alright... You wait here. I'll see if there's any commotion.
Jay? Everything alright...? Exhausted, Gatsby turns...
Jay... You oughtta go away. He helps Gatsby cover the car.
Tonight. They'll trace your car.
Do you understand that a woman has been killed--? Nick follows him from the garage toward the house.
But Jay she-- Sensing Nick's tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty.
What was in the letter? Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay...
Jay, I've got to go. I have to work.
I'll call you up.
I suppose so... Well... Goodbye. Nick lingers... Then they shake hands and he starts away. Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls:
They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together! First Gatsby nods politely, and then his face breaks into that radiant and understanding smile.
May I speak to Mrs. Buchanan? It's Mr. Carraway, her cousin...
Well, when you see her, will you tell her, the funeral's tomorrow?
Please, I know she would want to be there. If you could just get a message to her--
Its like an amusement park...
","I'm trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport? Nick shakes himself from his reverie.
Any time that suits you. Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan.
Lovely to see you Miss Baker.
Sorry to keep her from you, old sport. Don't forget; we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning. Herzog appears behind Gatsby.
Good night, old sport...
Its pretty isn't it, old sport...? Haven't you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine. Get dressed... We're having lunch!
Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old sport... What's your opinion of me, anyhow?
Yes, yes, your opinion! Gatsby yanks the wheel; Nick hangs on for dear life!
I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all those bizarre accusations you must be hearing. A pack of lies I assure you. You've heard the stories...?
I'll tell you God's truth. God's truth about myself! (raises right hand) I am the son of some very wealthy people from the Middle-West; sadly, all dead now... I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford; because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. You see, it's a... a family tradition. As Gatsby's speech continues at breakneck speed... Nick's V.O. fades up.
After that I lived like a young Prince in all the capitals of Europe!
Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki... Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago...
Then came the war, old sport...
It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life...
In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns... Something catches Nick's eye... NICK'S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson's Garage.
...When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead. SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing!
I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea. SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick's lap.
Here! That's the one from Montenegro. It looks authentic.
Turn it.
That's right. SLAP! A photograph joins the medal.
Here's another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster. CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand.
Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don't want you to think I'm just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I'm going to make a very big request of you today.
Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon.
Oh, I assure you it's nothing underhand. Miss Baker's an honest sportswoman; she'd never do anything that wasn't alright... RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside.
Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year.
Meyer, Meyer...
Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr. Wolfsheim. Gatsby guides Nick and Wolfsheim toward the back of the shop.
We'll talk about that later... The HEAD WAITER appears.
Yes, highballs it is. (points to Nick) You take good care of my friend here! A portly man of obvious stature, surrounded by scantily clad flappers, yells from a corner booth.
You be careful now. You're turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner.
You be careful at those tables now Senator!
Shall we order? (to the waiter) Lobster tails all round.
No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about.
Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to make THAT call. (gesturing to Nick) Meyer, do you mind? Gatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone.
Gentlemen. Everything alright...?
(taking his seat) Other people's wives? Ah... I see. Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim.
Other people's wives... Meyer? Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls...
You'll have to excuse him... In his old age, he's prone to ""digress..."" He's a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway...
Meyer? He's a gambler. Over Nick and Gatsby's shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction...
Meyer? No. He's the man who fixed the 1919 World Series.
Fixed it.
He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He's a very smart man. (tries to change subject) Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of... Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table.
I'm so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance. Tom turns back to Nick.
Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use of it all summer...
Oh, that's alright. I don't want to put you to any trouble...
What day would suit you...? I don't want to put you to any trouble...
Day after tomorrow? Well, I'd... I'd want to get the grass cut. They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick's ragged lawn ends and Gatsby's manicured one begins.
There's another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-- You don't make much money, do you?
If you'll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I'm saying right? You're selling bonds, aren't you, old sport?
Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money.
You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim. I assure you.
A favor?
Ah, right, right... Goodnight.
One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal... An awkward beat.
Grass? Gatsby looks at Nick without really comprehending, or seeing.
What Grass?
Have you got everything you need?
I think they did a fine job, don't you?
You think it's too much?
I think so too... She'll be impressed, won't she old sport?
I can't wait all day. I'm leaving!
Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late! BEEEEEP! Gatsby glimpses Daisy's Rolls Royce arriving out front, and turns to Nick, flushed with fresh panic.
I'm... certainly glad to see you as well. Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating. EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the
We've met before... SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby's elbow...
Ah... sorry... He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again!
(an automatic reflex) Five years next November. The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing.
I've got to speak to you...!
Oh, God! This is a mistake, a terrible, terrible mistake...
She's embarrassed?
Don't talk so loud!
Yes, it has...
What do you think of that, Daisy? Come look. Daisy joins Gatsby and they step out onto the porch together.
I know. I have the same view from my place.
Nick, I want you and Daisy both to see my house. I'd like to show her around.
Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely.
Do you like it?
I don't. I keep it always full of interesting, celebrated people... As Daisy runs ahead, Gatsby murmurs to Nick.
My house looks well doesn't it? See how the whole front catches the light like that? Daisy yells back...
If you press this button here, the oranges shoot through here, are crushed there... The juice of 200 oranges extracted in one hour...! Gatsby presses, the machine groans and juice splashes out!
Its a remarkable little camera-- latest design. While, nearby, a butler in a boat stands watch over a spinning gramophone and bottles of champagne...
She looks like she could be on the cover of Vogue, don't you think...?
Its a custom Wurlitzer.
Klipspringer can. (to his footmen) Someone wake Ewing! Daisy twirls round, overjoyed...
Ewing's a symphonic genius, he can play anything...! Daisy runs up the stairs and calls down...
(as if in a dream) She makes it look so splendid, don't you think old sport?
I've got a man in England who buys me clothes...! He playfully tosses Daisy a boater-hat...
Something for the lady... Then he begins yanking down shirts and tossing them over the rail to Daisy...
He sends over a selection at the beginning of each season...
These are silk! Linen! Indian flannel! Egyptian cotton! Daisy, intoxicated, leaps on the bed, arms outstretched...
What is it?
Why?
If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light...
The one that burns all night at the end of your dock. As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay...
No, no.. That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport... He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago. Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps. In the photo with Cody, also in yachting costume, is a young Gatsby...
I want to show you something... Look, here's a lot of clippings, about you. They admire a scrapbook together.
This was my first photo of you. As Daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers, we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER:
Excuse me. Gatsby crosses the room, snatches up the receiver, and turns away... He lowers his voice.
Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake! Shall we?
It will be... Across the room, Nick, exhausted and drunk and unnoticed, stands to leave. At the ballroom doors he turns back and glimpses Gatsby and Daisy, in a universe all their own...
We've got a great band here. Have a look around... Excuse me... He turns briefly to talk to Senator Gulick...
May I introduce Senator Gulick? This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs. Buchanan...
And Mr. Buchanan... (a moment's hesitation) The polo player.
(to the group) May I show you around? He guides them down the stairs...
You must see the faces of a lot of people you've heard of.
Perhaps you know that lady there? Gatsby indicates a lovely, orchid of a woman: MARLENE MOON, the silent film star.
I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago.
That's right. See... I know your wife.
Yes. As the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity.
Not now. Herzog silently recedes... A romantic foxtrot strikes up - Trimalchio introduces...
Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly?
No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it...
Run away? Darling, no. Daisy, that... that wouldn't be... respectable.
We're going to live here, in this house, together. You and me... Daisy... It's time for you to tell Tom.
Excuse me. Nick, would you mind? As Gatsby follows Herzog back toward the castle....
She didn't like it.
No, she didn't like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It's hard to make her understand.
The party!? I couldn't care less about the parties! You see...
She has to tell Tom that she never loved him.
Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents' house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we'll be married there... You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago.
Ask too much?
I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and--
Can't repeat the past?
Why of course you can. Of course you can. You'll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything's been so... so confused since then... Gatsby looks out to the green light.
If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again.
I knew that, that when I kissed this girl, I would... be forever wed to her...
So I stopped. And I waited... I waited...
And then I just let myself go.
I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I'm only 32... I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this... He draws a slanting line from the lawn to the stars.
It's got to keep going up. Gatsby looks to the green light.
She has to go to Tom and tell him she never loved him... I need to give her more time. I just need to give her more time... He turns to Nick, reassuring both of them.
Don't worry old sport, don't worry. I can protect her here. Good night old sport... Gatsby heads for his castle, and turns and calls...
You're wrong about the past, old sport...! Gatsby's POV: The green light across the bay.
You're wrong.
Then don't.
Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love.
Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn't gossip... until we decided what we're going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand?
What's the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...?
I'm right across from you.
Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking.
You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I-- With sudden intensity Daisy stands!
I don't think there's much gas, old sport. Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare.
Why not let her alone, old sport?
What is? Tom turns to Gatsby...
No, not exactly.
Yes - I went there. Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting.
(slow, intense) I told you I went there.
You'd like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man. Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. But they are all looking at Gatsby.
You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war. Nick can't help but smile.
Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on.
Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me!
No, old sport. See, she never loved you... She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me!
Daisy and I have nothing to hide...
I just told you what's been going on; its been going on for five years...! Tom turns to Daisy sharply.
Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know...
No...
That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this... all this pain will be wiped out forever. Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly.
You never loved him. Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing.
That's right...
(shocked, uncomprehending) You loved me too?
I want to speak to Daisy alone. She's all excited now...
You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you.
What about it, old sport?
Well your friend Walter Chase isn't too proud to come in on it.
It's called `greed,' old sport.
He's got nothing to do with--
(a vicious sneer) The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that's it, and now I've just as much as you; so that means we're equal!! Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn.
Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don't listen to him Daisy. Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently.
Daisy...! Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel.
No...! BUT the car STRIKES Myrtle!
Hello old sport... Cautiously, Nick approaches the hedge. The closer he gets the more certain he becomes: Gatsby is hiding, just below Daisy's window. His pace quickens.
Just sitting here...
Did you see any trouble out on the road?
I thought so... I told Daisy I
Its better that the shock should come all at once--
Please... Keep your voice down, old sport.
It, it killed her instantly. I--
I understand-- It was... my fault. This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us... It all happened so quickly. She-- I... tried-- to turn the wheel.
You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us. CUT TO: We replay the violent accident, this time fully REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel...
It all happened so quickly. It wasn't her fault...
It was my fault. I should have taken the wheel...
No. No. No. I'm going to wait. I'll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy's locked herself in her room, and she's going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever--
Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don't trust him. Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace.
Would you do that for me? Thank you. Thank you, old sport.
Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything's just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light... So... (beckons to the car) Give me a hand will you old sport? CLOSE ON: Nick.
(as if Nick is crazy) Go away? I can't leave now. Not tonight.
Daisy's going to call in the morning. Then we'll make plans, to go away together.
She just needs time to think... (he continues, calm) She'll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think.
She just needs to think. She's going to call in the morning. Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... He turns to go in but stops.
Wait up with me? The suns almost up...
You know, I thought for awhile I had a lot of things... But the truth is... I'm empty.
I suppose that's why I make things up about myself... But I`ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time... You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well-- As Gatbsy continues, Nick's V.O. FADES UP:
...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too.
I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be.
I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... Finally, Nick is able to ask:
The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn't been able to return-- In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: ""Daisy, the truth is... I'm penniless.""
You see, I felt married to her... That was all.
Now now. Keep it open. For a personal call...
Not today. It's so beautiful.
Let's go for a swim. I'll have the phone transferred to the pool... As Gatsby heads toward the pool, Nick checks his watch...
I understand... Well, I'll walk you out. Gatsby leads Nick toward the side gate. At the gate...
Do, old sport, please do.
Daisy... Then his face hardens as he slowly falls backwards... SPLASH! Placing his gun in his mouth Wilson pulls the trigger.
She makes it look so splendid, don't you think, old sport?
Will you come old sport? We... need you.
It will be...
","Do they miss me in Chicago?
I'm p-paralyzed with happiness...! Daisy takes Nick's hand and squeals with childish glee as she drags him over the sofa and onto his back on the floor. He stares up... And, a mysterious, athletic girl glares back. This is 22 year old, JORDAN BAKER.
Jordan Baker; a very famous golfer. CLOSE ON: Nick, the blood drains from his face...
I know! This summer I'll sort of, fling you and Jordan together... As Tom prepares drinks at the bar, he glances skittishly at a white telephone set ostentatiously upon a marble pedestal.
I'll push you into linen closets, and out to sea in boats...
Your life is adorable. Jordan toys with a golf club, and speaks with bored contempt.
Gatsby? CLOSE ON: Daisy, as she struggles to control rising emotion.
What Gatsby...? Before anyone can reply, Henri announces--
Would you like to hear a family secret? Its about the butler's nose...
Nicky... I heard a rumor, that you were getting married to a girl out west...
(subtly mocking Tom) We've got to beat them down. SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring.
I'm sorry... She follows Tom into the house. Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan.
(a tense gayety) I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose... Doesn't he?
Nicky, stay--
Oh Nicky...
Its just, well, you see, I think everything's terrible anyhow. You know I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I've had very bad time Nicky... I'm pretty cyncical about everything. Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence. Nick tries to change the subject--
Pammy? Oh yes... Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk.
Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.' She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers...
All the bright precious things fade so fast... And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby's castle...
And they don't come back.
Leave me alone!
Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? She looks at him with a mysterious smile.
Why did I have to come alone? Are you in love with me?
Come back in an hour, Ferdie!
What's funny? KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door.
I'm certainly glad to see you again. Gatsby's face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. Finally, he finds words...
(desperate for small talk) Lovely though. A lovely... clock. Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle. Gatsby takes a seat. A long silent beat.
We haven't met for many years.
Look. Its my house. Just there across the bay... Gatsby and Daisy's eyes meet.
Where's your place? Gatsby turns back to Nick.
Oh, Jay...!? Its so grand!
I love it...! But how do you live here all alone?
You do know, I'm a champion golfer, don't you? Here, I'll show you how its done. CRACK! Daisy cuts a marvelous swing, snapping a club in two! She falls into Gatsby arms... Nick films...
Oh...! Its beautiful.
Can anyone play it?
Music! And we can dance all night!
Then I demand a Charleston! Gatsby gazes up after Daisy, and confides in Nick...
I've never seen anything like it!
Jay! With ever-increasing enthusiasm!
No, Jay... you'll ruin them!
It's just... It makes me sad, because... Daisy glances in Nick's direction...
...because... A suspended moment; Daisy is incapable of speaking her heart.
It's just... Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before.
What green light?
I wish that it could always be like this...
Not Gatsby. He's a businessman.
He owned a lot of drug stores. Gatsby gracefully introduces Senator Gulick to the group...
Delighted...
Oh Tom... You should be proud of your achievements.
Absolutely!
(taking Gatsby's arm) Its Marlene Moon... I adore her pictures... As Gatsby leads Daisy, we catch Tom repeating to Nick...
In case you need to take down any addresses... As Tom fumes, Gatsby leads Daisy out onto the dance floor. PUSH CLOSE ON: Tom, growing increasingly suspicious...
Is all this made entirely from your own imagination?
It's perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination...
I... I wish we could just run away.
Remember how much fun we used to have? Why can't we just have fun like that again? Gatsby, frustrated, is about to speak... But Nick suddenly appears out of the shadows... Gatsby and Daisy break off, startled...
Oh hello Nicky; we're having a row.
About things... About the future... (trying to be funny) The future of the Colored Empires.
With Nicky. Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds.
I don't want to go home. Gatsby hold her tighter.
(on the verge of tears) It's so hot... Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard.
Everything's so confused. She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with the paperweight-sized lighter.
What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon...? And the day after that... (she snaps it again) ...and for the next thirty years?
(as if they are alone) You look so cool. You always look so cool, like the advertisement of the man... in Times Square... CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening.
The man in the cool, beautiful, shirts. CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM... He violently snuffs his cigar.
Just like that? Can't anyone at least have a cigarette?
Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to fuss.
I've changed my mind...
Fine. Have it your own way, Tom... Come on, Jordan. As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns calmly to Gatsby.
You take Nick and Jordan, Tom! She slips quickly into the coupé...
We'll meet you at the Plaza! I'll be the man on the corner smoking two cigarettes... Gatsby's and Tom's eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance. Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust.
Open another window.
Then telephone for an axe...
Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute. Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly.
Tom...! Gatsby stands.
I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself... But Tom's not done yet.
He isn't causing a row; you're causing a row. Please have a little self-control!
Jay let's go, please...!
You're revolting... Daisy's voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with thrilling scorn...
Do you know why we left Chicago...? I'm surprised they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree. Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy.
Why, how could I love him, possibly?
I never loved him.
No.
Please don't.
There, Jay. She trembles as she looks to Gatsby...
You want too much! I love you now; isn't that enough? I can't help what's past. (begins to sob) I did love him once; but I loved you too.
Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom. It wouldn't be true.
As if it mattered to you.
(with visible effort) I am, though.
My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper. Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists.
Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore! Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom.
(explains to Pammy) Daddy's taking care of his two favorite girls...
Just for a little trip. Just you, me, and daddy...
But how do you live her all alone?
Music! And then we can dance all night...
I wish it could always be like this...
Its perfect... From your perfect, irresistible imagination.
","Shakespeare! How's the great American novel coming...?
Never heard of em. Tom slaps Nick with irritating heartiness!
Hey! What say after dinner we go into town?
Catch up with the old wolf pack?
Nonsense! We're going.
First team, all-American! Tom admires his own achievements.
You see? Made me who I am today. Tom pulls his favorite trophy from the cabinet--
Here-- Forest Hills... I played the Prince of Wales. What a sissy! Tom exchanges the trophy for a football.
Life's something you dominate Nick. He pelts Nick with the ball--
If you're any good. Nick fumbles as Tom charges him--
Ha-ha-ha! Tom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of vaulting doors, and into...
Nick, Daisy tells me you're over at
throwing your lot in with those social-climbing, primitive New Money types...?
Civilization's going to pieces! Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this fellow Goddard?
Everyone ought to read it. The idea is that its up to us, the dominant race, to watch out, or these other races... Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant--
Will have control of things.
It's been proved. Its scientific.
Excuse me... I'll be right back. He goes inside. An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down.
So... After dinner Nick wanted to go into town. Right Nick? To the Yale club.
Nonsense. Its only for a drink or two. Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance. SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all freeze. BRINNNGGG! PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek.
Come on--!
Trust me!
Hello Wilson! How's business?
I've got my man working on it.
Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway.
Nick's a writer... Myrtle is completely uninterested.
(intently to Myrtle) Get on the next train.
Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister... (glancing to Nick) She'll like him...
(whispers to Nick) Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? That's rude.
Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep. Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet.
(grabbing Nick's arm) Nonsense...
Listen Nick, you like to watch; I remember that from college. And that's OK, I make no judgment; but we've got a whole summer - do you want to sit on the sideline and watch, or do you want to play ball?
Hey Nick! McKee's in the artistic game.
Nick's artistic.
Hey McKee, take a picture of that!
You've got no right to speak her name! Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed...
Hey Nick! Nick! Where've you been!? Daisy's furious you haven't called up. Nick and Gatsby stand.
I wouldn't have expected to find you in this temple of virtue.
(mutters to Daisy) A lot of these newly rich people are just filthy bootleggers.
I'd rather not be the polo player.
I'd really rather not be the polo player...
That's right... And you were with Nick here. At the barbershop...
Is that so?
Of course not; I think I can keep myself amused. As Daisy takes Gatsby's arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil into Tom's breast pocket and murmurs...
I wonder where the devil he met Daisy...? He notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him...
Have you seen my wife...? Startled, Nick turns...
That's funny. The Senator said he saw her down here. Tom follows Nick's gaze down toward the tree...
That so...?
Where were you?
Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together... DAISY'S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle.
You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year... Blue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates...
Or wait a minute; it's the opposite... Tom stands and strolls to the open French window...
The sun is getting colder every year... Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table. CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby. The tension is excruciating. Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay.
How I'd like to be out on that bay today. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle.
What light? Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy's...
Town!? Women... They get these notions... Gatsby walks to Daisy... As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy's trembling hand... In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet...
Let's go to town! I'm perfectly willing...! That's a marvelous idea! Henri! Have the car brought around immediately!
We've smoked all through lunch.
It was your great idea Daisy. Why don't we!? We'll all go to town! Daisy doesn't budge.
(a dangerous intensity) You've got me all excited, and now you don't want to go? We'll get a great big room at the Plaza, a cold bucket of ice, and some whiskey... It will be fun.
Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby? Then turns and calls to Henri...
Henri! Get some whiskey! Two bottles, wrapped in a towel.
Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good enough to take my coupé? And I'll drive everyone else in your circus wagon.
(looks at the gauge) Plenty of gas. And if we run out, then we'll stop at a drug store. I hear you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays... (savagely eyes Gatsby) Isn't that right, Mr. Gatsby? A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom's arm.
You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? But I have a-- an almost second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. And I've made a small investigation of this fellow.
Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink suit for Christ's sake! With that, Tom shifts gears and the Duesenberg rockets on!
Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let's have some gas...
Your wife does...? Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle's face, badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates...
What do I owe you!?
You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow! He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coupé!
That's enough... The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration.
Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it.
That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?
'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up?
Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.
Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford.
Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford!
I heard you, but I'd like to know when.
Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.
What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow? They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content.
Self-control! I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife? Well, if that's the idea you can count me out... See, nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next you know they'll throw everything overboard and we'll have intermarriage between black and white!
You must be crazy.
Sit down Daisy!
What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.
You've been seeing him for five years?
Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then - but I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a god-damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now. Tom starts to make himself a drink...
She does, though... And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time...
Not at Kapiolani?
(a husky tenderness) Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry...? Daisy? Never?
Daisy... Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone.
Of course it wouldn't. Daisy turns to her husband.
Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.
Nonsense.
She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler! Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby.
Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim's bunch. Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly.
See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter!
Don't call me `old sport!' This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now.
I've been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim?
That's right; you've got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend...
My God, he has...
With your little racket...
Oh no, no, we're different; I am, (gesturing at Nick and
we're all different from you - we were born different, it's in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...! Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage.
That's right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners... Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears.
You two start on home...
Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over. Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her.
Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? Nick?
Want any?
Happy birthday... Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought...
Wreck...! Good. Wilson will have a little business at last... Let's take a look..
Just a look.
Get off me...! (regains his composure) I'm fine. I'm fine.
(a long pause) No... Not really...
What happened...?
(a soothing gruffness) Pull yourself together... Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into:
Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coupé. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon. The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom.
Blue, a coupé; we've come straight from New York.
(a tiny pause) Fella named Gatsby; he's a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about...
Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows... Wilson starts sobbing again.
Gatsby. Something outta be done about a fella like that. He'll pay... Oh, he'll pay...
The goddamn coward didn't even stop his car... Jordan and Nick sit silently beside Tom; he turns to them, triumphantly accusing...
You gonna defend him now, huh?
I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait... Tom opens the door.
What is the matter with you? Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick's arm.
Its going to be all right...
","Works pretty slow, don't he?
I don't mean that, I just...
Oh, sure... Sure... Wilson hurries out back.
I'm sick. I'm all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West.
I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin' whether she wants to or not. Tom isn't listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high- speed, threatening to leave him in the dust!
Dollar twenty. The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And then jumps into the Duesenberg.
God knows everything you've been doing! Grabbing his wife's hair he presses her face to the window.
You might fool me but you can't fool God! OVER WILSON'S SHOULDER, we see with shock, that he is looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg.
God sees everything! Below the Eckleberg sign a train thunders through the level crossing. The final carriage clears to reveal Gatsby's yellow car waiting on the other side of the crossing. CLOSE ON: Myrtle seeing the yellow car; a desperate whisper.
O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! A crush of gawking spectators speak in hushed tones. CUT TO: Tom pushing through the crowd. CLOSE ON: He stops, and makes a harsh sound... MYRTLE'S BODY, wrapped in a blanket, lies on a work table. Tom bends over it, shocked, motionless. CUT TO: Nick, watching Tom's reaction. A POLICEMAN stands next to Tom taking down names.
You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson.
Who owns the yella' car...?
Maybe he was the one foolin' with Myrtle; maybe that's why he killed her...?
Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! He rests his head on Tom's shoulder... Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers...
God sees everything.
