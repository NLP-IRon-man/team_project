(still distorted) I can't think of anything.
Yes. We're men. Men is what we are.
(listless management speak) You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
(into phone) Yes. I'd like to order the Erika Pekkari slip covers. Jack drops the open catalog on the floor. MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...
No, I don't want Cobalt. Oh, that sounds nice. Apricot. Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.
Maybe I died already. Look at my face.
Can't you give me something?
I'm in pain.
(into phone) No, I just can't believe that card is declined -- Okay, okay, let me give you a different card number. Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.
Marla, you liar, you big tourist. I need this. Get out.
Hi, Chloe.
You look good. You ... look ... like a pirate. Chloe laughs, a little too much. Jack squeezes out a laugh. Then he sees Marla, off by herself. Someone heads for her.
Excuse me, I have to... Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla. Chloe watches him go. STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her. He whispers into her ear.
We need to talk.
I'm on to you. You're a faker. You aren't dying.
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying. But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
You're a tourist. I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
Practicing what?
I'll expose you.
Why are you doing this?
These are my groups. I was here first. I've been coming for a year.
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
I... I don't know. I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
Yeah. Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.
(warning) It becomes an addiction.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Please. Can't we do something... ? Marla starts out of the room. Jack follows her.
We'll split up the week. You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
You're kidding.
You can't have both parasites. You can take blood parasites --
Okay. I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
You can't have the whole brain!
Then, take blood parasites. It's yours. Now we each have three. Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...
You... left half your clothes. HONK! Jack starts. Marla's led him into the street with traffic barreling down. Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS BLARING. Jack dashes, following...
You're selling those? Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot. He winces in pain.
I want ascending bowel cancer. The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.
We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Let's not make a big thing out of it. She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
In case we want to switch nights.
If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.
Oh, you wouldn't believe.
A major one. Turgid silence. Jack turns to the window. He sees a PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.
Pardon me? Tyler turns to Jack.
No, supply oxygen?
What do you do, Tyler?
I mean -- for a living.
We have the same briefcase. Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting ""single-serving"" friend I've ever met. Tyler stares back. Jack, enjoying his own chance to be witty, leans closer to Tyler.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
What?
(thrown) Well, uh... great.
Excuse me? ""Throwers?""
My suitcase was vibrating?
(to Security TFM) I had everything in that bag. My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Hello?
Tyler?
Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the plane. We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I just called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
You buy furniture. You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need. No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled. Then, the right set of dishes. The right dinette.
I guess so.
All gone. Tyler offers cigarettes. Jack declines.
There's always that.
...no ...no ...
(toasts) Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Insurance'll cover it.
What list?
I don't... think so.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Don't I?
(looks at watch) God, it's late. I should find a hotel...
Yeah.
I don't follow...
Huh?
No, I...
Would that be a problem?
Can I stay at your place?
Thank you.
What's that?
What?
Tyler was a night person. He sometimes worked as a projectionist. A movie doesn't come in one big reel, it's on a few. In old theaters, two projectors are used, so someone has to change projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel begins. Sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand corner... Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.
It's called a ""changeover."" The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution... In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming, confused, looking at each other. A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling vaguely terrible. Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans back in his seat. Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel. The GUESTS command the WAITERS with snaps of fingers.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
You get the idea.
I don't know about this.
No. That's a good thing, isn't it?
Me? Jack stares at him.
This is crazy.
Where do you want it? In the face?
Shit. Sorry. That didn't count.
Strange.
Is it?
Call what off?
What fight?
Anyone?
My boss, probably. (pause) Who would you fight?
Oh, yeah. (nodding) I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
I know that.
Same here.
We should do this again sometime. Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.
Where's your car?
What?
(""Reader's Digest"") ""I am Joe's Lungs."" It's written in first person. ""Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."" There's a whole series -- ""I am Joe's Prostate.""
What are you reading?
Show-off.
(handing him reports) Yes.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Doesn't matter.
Shatner. William Shatner. They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their cigarettes, getting on board...
(to Tyler, so the Man can hear) You could take him. Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man. Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.
... stop...
Look at me. How about next month? Everyone helps Jack walk. He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.
I fell down some stairs.
Okay... Ghandi.
You?
Hello?
Marla? Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups. Jack leans, cups the phone.
(quietly) How did you find me?
That's the idea -- we split them.
I found a new one.
It's for men.
Look, this is a bad time...
I'm just on my way out...
So you're staying in tonight?
You're not going to believe what I dreamt last night. Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's been raped by a hurricane. Jack's jaw drops.
What are you doing here?
What the hell are you doing here? Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.
No. Not at all.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker.
What?
Okay.
Yes, I promise.
I said I promise!
I... uh... just going to bed. Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.
Uh... nah... Jack continues toward his room.
Some of it, yes. Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.
Yeah. Speaking.
Yes?
No, I wasn't aware...
Yes, sire, strange. Very strange. Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.
Dynamite?
What does that mean?
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
Huh?
Shhhhhh! (into phone, overlap w/above) I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
(into phone) No. No, sir. I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me. The dishes were me. The plants were...
(keeps scrubbing) Worth every penny.
(coldly) It suits you. She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:
You get rid of her.
I, uh... think you should go now. Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things, pushing other things off to the floor.
It's time for you to leave.
Goodbye. She laughs, spins on her heels. As she exits the back door, she sings ""This Merry-Go-Round"" from ""Valley of the Dolls."" Jack watches her through the kitchen window.
What is this place?
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
I... I think I understand. I think I get it...
No, I'm not...
I don't know...
It isn't... ?
We don't... ?
... Marla ... ?
You ... you don't know what this feels like, Tyler. Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand. Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes. Tyler grabs a bottle of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound. Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.
Hmm?
""Abuse"" the copy machine. There's an image.
Me? I'd be very careful who I talked to about this. It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it... someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co- workers. Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts tearing it into pieces.
Might be someone you've known for years... somebody very close to you. Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up. Jack puts the PAPER in his trash. Bass stares with a tinge of outrage, a tinge of fear. PHONE RINGS. Jack answers it.
Compliance and Liability.
Just a second. (to Boss; smiles) Could you excuse me? I need to take this call. Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.
(into phone) What are you talking about?
I don't know ...
This is a sweet side of you. Picking these up for ... (reads the boxes:) ""Mrs. Haniver"" and... ""Mrs. Raines."" Where are they?
No, thanks.
Nothing.
Where? Here?
There?
Here.
No. Jack's head is behind Marla's. They speak softer, slower.
Okay. Okay, I'm sure.
Nothing. Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.
No... no problem.
I think everything's okay here.
Uh ... nah.
So.... are we done? Marla sighs.
Bob. I'm okay. How are you?
Really? Great. Still ""Remaining Men Together?"" An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.
Really, what's that?
Oh.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Look at my face. Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.
Yeah, both of us.
You're welcome.
You quit?
Work. Going to work. Tyler scratches his chin absently.
What... ?
We need to talk.
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise. Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.
Let's pretend. You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
What about this? Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut. I won't need to come to the office. I can do this job from home. Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.
Please... don't hit me again, please. I'm your responsibility... He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again. He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents flying. He hits the floor.
Please... give me the paychecks like I asked for. I won't be any trouble. You won't see me again. Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off. Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.
Please... please...
(gurgling blood) Please don't hit me again.
Six months advance pay. Six months!
Okay, and... and... Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of CARDS.
Forty-eight airline flight coupons. Plus... hold on... just a minute... Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door. He drags an unwieldy SHOPPING CART in behind him; filled with his COMPUTER, PHONE, FAX and other office equipment.
I am now officially self-employed. Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
I thought you did. In the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot -- front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks.
What are we doing?
What is it? Tyler takes out a HANDGUN, hands the backpack back.
Tyler...
Tell him!
Answer him!
I feel sick.
I don't care, that was horrible. Tyler walks away.
Hey.
What did you guys do? They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER. They look at Jack and shake their heads. Jack doesn't get it. Suddenly, the guys' faces turn to stone. Bob sits rigid.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
(motions to car) After you, Mr. Durden...
No. Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.
Why wasn't I told about ""Project Mayhem?""
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.
This is as much mine as yours.
You know what I mean.
Look...
I want to know --
(to Ricky and Mechanic) Shut up!! (to Tyler) I want to know what's going on. Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates... Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...
What are you doing?!
Tyler... Tyler steers back into the proper lane. The other CAR flies past, HORN SOUNDING...
What the hell ... ?!
I'm not asking you to.
I don't think that's true. Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up. Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.
Tyler... what is this... ! Jack fights to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.
I don't know! Nothing!
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?! The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS. It moves to the other side of the road. Tyler steers there, too.
Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this. How's that?
What?
Okay, okay... fine... Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air. Tyler studies Jack face, impressed. Tyler makes no move to take the wheel. THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of the road, surrounded by flares. Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the shoulder... heading for the stalled car. Their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares. Tyler smiles. They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE! The back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass- over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...
You... don't have to... leave.
Really... I mean it. (pause) Have you been going to your groups?
When?
I don't know.
Why are we both... caught up like this... with... ?
I don't understand. Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
You hear that?
That... sawing and hammering.
(to Marla and Tyler) No.
(to Marla and Tyler) Nothing.
This conversation...
... is over. Marla comes to touch Jack's hair. Jack closes the basement door. Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his hand. Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.
... A person.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Let go of me... (pulls his hand free) Leave me alone.
(calling upstairs) Tyler... ? What's this for? From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.
Um... what can I do for you, Ricky? Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.
Wait a minute... Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.
""Too young?""
""Applicant?""
""Training?"" Tyler...
Uh, look. You're too... young to... train here. You should probably be on you way. No response from Ricky, who remains at attention. Jack goes back inside. Tyler closes the door.
Are you deaf?! I told you to leave! You will never get inside this house!
You're never getting through this door, you stupid little weasel! Look at me when I talk to you... ! He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.
What is your major malfunction!?
Bob... Bob, wait... (leading Bob back) Let me explain this to you...
Tyler... The room is empty. Jack stares.
Where's Tyler?
Right, right. As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE- BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.
Get away from me!
The Paper Street Soap Company.
He's not here.
He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away! Marla stares at Jack, miserable. A tear runs down her cheek. She turns and walks away. Jack watches her go. There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING. Jack heads to the back door...
What's going on? Space Monkeys stare at the body. The Mechanic, sweating, gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse -- it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD.
Bob... oh, Christ... Jack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken...
What... what happened... ?
What... ?
No... ! Space Monkeys stop. Jack gets between them and Bob, SHOVES a few Space Monkeys back...
Get your hands off him! Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?! This is a man... ! You killed him!
No! Look at you! You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
What he wanted? Look... look at him. Look at him! What does he want? (wipes tears, points at Bob) This is a person. This is not a cog in your machine...
No, no. This is a man -- this man has a name...
No! Wrong! This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson is dead. He's dead, because of you...
No -- !
No!
Stop that -- !
Tyler?
(to driver, points) Here. Let me out, right here...
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
This is an emergency. It's important I find him.
I need to know where Tyler is. Can't you help me?
(pointing) There's no one else here.
Look at my face. I'm a member. I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
You are a moron.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
... You know me?
Yes... it's a test.
What?
Who do you think I am?
Marla, it's me. Have we... have we ever had sex?
Because the answer's ""yes"" or because the answer's ""no?""
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
We did make love?
Answer the question!
What did you say... ?
Say my name.
Say my name! What's my name!?
Marla, no, wait... As Marla HANGS UP. Jack stares at the receiver, dazed...
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I'm you?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
I don't know! Tell me! Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated.
What... ?
What are you talking about... ?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away!
Anyone? (thinks) My boss, probably. (pause) Who would you fight? Jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him.
Oh, yeah. (nodding) I didn't really know my Dad...
(shouting) You are not your job. You are not how much money you have in the bank. TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell:
This isn't possible...
What... what are you saying?
No! This isn't true. We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
You have jobs.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Yes. The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER.
Bill me! Jack goes out the door, freezes. He rushes back in, going to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS.
Wait...when were these made?
I need a copy of this.
Wait here.
Who is this?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Excuse me?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Abort the plan.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Marla! Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away. Jack follows, hugging the files to his chest, catching up.
Marla...
I'm sorry, I...
Marla... I need to talk to you. It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
-- A little more faith than that.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Clean food, please.
Thanks, no clam chowder. That's it. The waiter snaps to attention and leaves.
(takes a deep breath) I know that I've been... unwell. I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I deserve that. Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me. I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
Sit down! Sit down and give me my last fifteen seconds without opening your mouth! Marla crosses her arms. Jack collects himself.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Marla...
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't explain. You wouldn't believe me anyway. I'm trying to protect you... Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races past. Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,
Do this for me, Marla. Do this for me, if you never do anything else... Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again. (digs in his pocket) Here... here... He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.
Take this money, get on this bus... (pointing to bus) Get on, and I promise you, I'll never bother you again, if that's what you want. Please... Marla looks at Jack, numb.
I'm begging you. Get on the bus. Get on the bus. Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus. As they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...
I can't let myself see where you're going. Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities... Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one last look at Jack.
Yes, fine. Just, get on. Stay away a couple of weeks, at least. Jack's still covering his eyes. Marla gets on the bus.
Son of a bitch!
(loudly) I want you to arrest me. I'm the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for acts of vandalism all over the city. Detective Stern in arson knows who I am...
There are probably several hundred members in the metropolitan area. Chapters are sprouting in at least five other major cities. They're tightly-regimented, with many cells capable of operating without a central leader. Check this address: 1537 Paper Street. You'll find the body of Robert Paulson buried in the garden. You'll also find numerous tubs used to make gallons of nitroglycerin. The plan, I believe, is to blow up these credit card headquarters and the TRW building.
You are not your job. You are not how much money you have in the bank.
What?
No... you're making a mistake!
I'm not Tyler Durden!
Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm ordering you to abort the mission!
(points at bomb) You... you can't be serious about this.
I can't let you...
I'm going to...
I'm not going...
Stop finishing...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
You don't know that. There could still be people inside. Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.
If you know, I know. Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go through the tangle of colored wires.
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Yes...
Fuck you.
Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in his head. Was that part of your plan? Tyler thinks, shrugs.
Fuck your struggle. I want out.
I quit.
Tyler...
(COCKS the gun) Defuse the bomb. Tyler stops walking.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Yes. Tyler strides towards the BOMB. Jack trains the gun...
Please. Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it. He grips the GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS. Jack lowers his gun.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.
(still distorted) I still can't think of anything. Tyler checks his watch.
(distorted) Can't you call it off... ?
Please...
Paraffin.
(relieved) Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb. (more) JACK (cont) They must've run out of cotton and Epsom salt. Paraffin is iffy at best. Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts pacing. Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.
Not exactly according to plan.
(pointing) How'd you do that?! You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Oh... Christ... Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.
Why... why... why... ?
Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away?
No, no, I don't. (pause) I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Noooo, please... Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.
... no, no, no...
Why are you doing this?!
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
I swear on my life, I won't...
What have you left for me?
Not my mouth. Our mouth. Tyler is calm.
It's the only way to get rid of you... Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.
Do something for me.
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
My eyes are open.
I'm okay... Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to see. TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla. One holds a gun to Marla as she struggles.
Everything's fine.
Bring the girl to me. The rest of you get out. Now! The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.
Don't ask. Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply. them to Jack's wound. Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.
Get to the rendezvous point. Move it! Jack and Marla are left alone.
Yes. Jack tries to got up. Marla helps him.
I did, I think. But, I'm okay... I'm fine... MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle... Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES; collapsing upon itself. Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES into a massive cloud of dust. Jack and Marla are silhouetted against the SKYLINE. Jack looks to Marla, reaches to take her hand.
I'm sorry... you met me at a very strange time in my life. Marla looks at him. ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER... The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES. EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS. Then, the IMPLODING BUILDING again. SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...
","One minute. (looking out window) This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
It's getting exciting now.
Look what we've accomplised. (checks watch) Thirty seconds.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola. Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Tyler Durden. Tyler offers his hand. Jack takes it.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths... Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback, hands it to Jack.
Suddenly, we become euphoic and docile. We accept our fate. Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.
Emergency water landing, 600 miles per hour. Blank faces -- calm as Hindu cows. Jack laughs.
What do you want me to do?
Why? So you can say, ""Oh, that's what you do."" -- And be a smug little shit about it? Jack laughs. Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him and lifts a BRIEFCASE.
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh. Jack points to his own briefcase.
Open it. Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.
Soap -- the yardstick of civilization. (reaches in his pocket) I make and sell soap... Tyler hands Jack his card. ""THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY.""
If you were to add nitric acid to the soap-making process, one would get nitroglycerin. With enough soap, one could blow up the world, if one were so inclined. Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut. Jack stares.
The spork. I get it. You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
Keep it up, then. Keep it right up. Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.
... As I squeeze past, do I give you the ass or the crotch? Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...
We are defined by the choices we make. Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the curtain aside and sits in an empty seat. Jack watches.
This is how we fill up our lives. Tyler lights a cigarette.
And, now it's gone.
Could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right? Jack laughs, nods. He shakes his head, drinks.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Delivered from bullshit colors like ""Cobalt,"" ""Ebony,"" and ""Fuchsia."" They laugh together. Then, silence. They drink.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The ""now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again"" list. That list.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
A hotel?
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Yes, you can.
You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can. Freeze picture.
They're called ""cigarette burns.""
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
One-forty-eighth of a second. That's how long it's up there.
A nice, big cock.
Don't watch. I can't if you watch. Jack waits. The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.
... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I don't know, either. I want to find out. I've never been hit, have you?
I don't want to die without any scars. How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it.
Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip.
Surprise me. Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.
Like hell. That counted. Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest. Jack falls back against a car. His eyes tear up.
How do you feel?
But a good strange.
We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off?
The fight.
This fight, pussy. Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under Tyler's ear. Tyler punches Jack in the stomach. Tyler and Jack move clumsily, throwing punches. They breathe heavier, drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Anyone. Jack thinks.
My dad. No question. A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.
He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, ""Now what?"" He said, ""Get a job."" When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, ""Now what?"" He said, ""I don't know. Get married.""
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need. Another pause. Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.
What car?
(of magazine) Hum.
Oh, a new riot control grenade... (reading) ""...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."" Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.
""I get cancer, and I kill Joe."" Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles, chooses another magazine.
Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic.
Welcome to fight club. The guys mill around, finding partners. Everyone brims with eagerness, but tries to act cool. CHATTER gets LOUDER. Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. The second rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. The third rule of fight club is -- when someone says ""stop"" or goes limp, the fight is over. Fourth rule is -- only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule -- one fight at a time. Sixth rule -- no shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule -- if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight. Tyler steps back. A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.
Alive or dead?
Hemingway. You?
Self-improvement is masturbation. Self-destruction is the answer. A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes. The Man takes a handle, close by. Jack's pissed, staring at the man, who stares back.
The trick is not to care. Tyler stares forward.
Cool. Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.
He fell down some stairs. The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.
Any historical figure.
Good answer.
Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger. Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a TOOTH. Jack looks at it. Tyler puts scissors down, done.
Remember, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart. Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.
She's a piece of work. Get this -- I come in here last night, the phone's off the hook... Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler. TYLER'S
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're sure?
Good. This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from that one.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute... Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it. Jack puts down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.
You've gotta understand something about me. I have a little rule, okay? Don't ever talk to her about me. Ever. I can't stand that kind of shit. Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out. And you'll never see me again. Promise me.
Promise you won't.
Promise?
That was three times you promised. Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves. Jack sits smoldering.
What are you doing? Jack steps back.
You want to finish her off?
(whispering in Jack's ear) Tell him... Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler standing right next to him.
(overlap w/below) ""The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception.""
""I reject the basic assumptions of civilization, including material possession."" Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.
Could be worse. You could be cursed with the three terrible Karmas. You could be beautiful, rich and famous. Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants. Marla's FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs... Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing water. He turns, sees Marla enter. Tyler is GONE. Marla lights a cigarette.
(pointing at Jack) Don't mention me. Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS. Jack looks to the archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE. Marla enters, shoes and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something on the junk strewn table.
To make soap, first we have to render fat. Jack looks at Tyler.
The best fat for making soap -- because the salt balance is just right -- comes form human bodies... Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.
A liposuction clinic. From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized, thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.
Paydirt. From society's richest asses and thighs. TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying BAGS of fat. One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down the chain-link fench. Jack slips and slides. Tyler laughs. Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface. Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
This clear layer in glycerin. We'll mix it back in when we make the soap. Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the glycerin layer. Then, he crabs a can, opens it.
Lye -- the crucial ingredient. (adding lye to mix) Ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river. Why? Because, human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Year after year, bodies burnt. Rain feel. Water seeped through the wood ashes to become lye. The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river. Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet. He takes Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.
The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes. Like the first monkeys shot into space. The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss. Tyler pours a bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.
Without sacrifice, without death, we would have nothing. Jack's whole body JERKS. Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand and arm. Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.
This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you've ever been burned and you will have a scar. Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of Tyler's kiss. Jack's face spasms.
Look at your hand.
Come back to the pain. Don't shut this out. Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away. Tyler keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.
Stop it. This is your pain -- your burning hand. It's right here. Look at it.
Don't deal with this the way those dead people do. Deal with it the way a living person does.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you. In all probability, He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen...
We don't need him...
Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it. Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes. Jack does his best to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled knot. He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.
You can go to the sink and run water over your hand. Look at me. Or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn, but first you have to give up. First, you have to know that someday, you are going to die. Until you know that, you will be useless. Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...
Congratulations. You're a step closer to hitting bottom.
No thanks, I quit.
Yeah. Where you headed?
Nothing. Do what you like. Tyler walks out the way he came.
Fucking sweet.
Good for you.
I look around... I look around and see a lot of new faces. An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.
Shut up! Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of fight club. A glum silence falls. Guys look at each other.
I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived -- an entire generation pumping gas and waiting tables; or they're slaves with white collars. (more) TYLER (cont) Advertisements have them chasing cars and clothes, working jobs they hate so they can buy shit they don't need. We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. We have no great war, or great depression. The great war is a spiritual war. The great depression is our lives. We were raised by television to believe that we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars -- but we won't. And we're learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed-off. The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement. Jack looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.
We are the quiet young men who listen until it's time to decide. A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.
Who are you?
Tyler Durden. Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
It's free to all.
Yes, it is.
You're welcome to join our club.
You and your friend. Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.
No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face. Some of the guys move forward, but the Thug points his gun. Jack-runs forward anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face. More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.
We really need to use this place. Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his face, his stomach. Tyler collapses to the floor. Lou starts KICKING his. Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.
That's it.... that's good. Get it all out. You'll feel better. Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more. Finally, sweating, bewildered, Lou stops. He looks to the Thug, who is just as bewildered. Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...
Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and this whole fucking world... Tyler's blood spatters on Lou. Lou tries to shake Tyler off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE. The Thug grabs Tyler and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou. Lou slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood. Tyler spits and shouts through clenched teeth...
You don't know where I've been. Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor. Tyler rubs his bloody face into Lou's face. The Thug lifts Tyler. Tyler clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...
We need this place. We need it. Please let us keep it, please... Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs.
Thank you. Thank you, sir...
This week, each of you has a homework assignment. You're going to go out and start a fight with a total stranger... (pause, drooling blood) You're going to start a fight... and you're going to lose. Jack beams in appreciation.
I heard. Local 15, Monday nights. As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS...
Newcastle? Did you start that one?
Let me have that a minute... Tyler takes the BACKPACK, unzips it, searching the contents.
Homework assignment.
Human Sacrifice. Jack turns white, staring at the gun.
Give me your wallet. The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler snatches it. Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A. A small, cramped basement apartment.
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die. Tyler rummages through the wallet.
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
An expired community college student ID card. What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
""Stuff."" Were the mid-terms hard? Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.
I asked you what you studied.
Why?
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel? Raymond weeps and says nothing. Tyler COCKS the gun. Raymond GASPS.
The question, Raymond, was ""what did you want to be?"" A beat.
Animals.
Stuff. That means you have to get more schooling.
Would you rather be dead?
I'm keeping your license. I know where you live. I'm going to check on you. If you aren't back in school and on your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead. Get the hell out of here. Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway. Jack and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.
Imagine how he feels. Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger -- CLICK. Empty.
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessell's life. Jack watches Tyler go.
His breakfast will taste better than any meal he has ever eaten. Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran. He finally turns back, following after Tyler.
(muttering quietly) ... You are not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the shoes you wear. Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...
You are not the contents of your wallet...
Hey. Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table. Tyler comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.
Go on in. We're celebrating.
Wrap it around the top of his hackie- sack.
You're not going to continue your ""rigorous investigation."" You will publicly state that there is no underground group. Or -- imagine, the rest of your life with your scrotum flapping empty.
We'll send one to the New York Times and one to the Los Angeles Times. Press release style. Your nuts will be bicoastal. Understood? The people you're after are everyone you depend on. (more) TYLER (cont) We do your laundry, cook your food and serve you dinner. We guard you while you sleep. We drive your ambulances. Do not fuck with us. Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
No... after you.
Something on your mind?
What should I have told you?
Fight club was the beginning. Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me?
What do you want? A statement of purpose... ?
Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your ""action item list?""
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
This does not belong to us. We are not the leaders. We are not special.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. We are all part of the same compost heap...
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
You're asking questions that don't have answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
What will you wish you'd done before you died?
(to Jack) And you?
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
I want to hear the truth.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! It's not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me. Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the wheel... the car swerves... The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING. Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air. Jack looks at Tyler with dead eyes.
We just had a near-life experience.
In the world I see -- you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You will wear leather clothes that last you the rest of your life. You will climb the wrist- thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. You will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying-strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway. Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.
(leaving) Feel better, champ.
(harsh whisper) You're not talking about me, are you? Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.
(still a whisper) What are you talking about?
(whisper) This conversation...
... is over.
You're too young. Sorry.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Look, friend, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. It's not the end of the world. Just go away. You're trespassing and I will call the police. Nothing personal.
You have two black shirts? Two pair black trousers? One pair black boots? Two pair black socks? One black coat? Three hundred dollars personal burial money? Go inside. Ricky goes in. Tyler turns to Bob.
You're too old. Sorry. And, you're too fat. Nice seeing you. Bob looks genuinely hurt. He picks up his mattress and starts away. Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes. Jack follows Bob...
A monkey, ready to be shot into space. A Space Monkey, ready to sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem. From here on, all those with shaved heads: ""SPACE MONKEYS.""
Four in Milwaukee.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise. You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Is this really news to you?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
And, sometimes you control it...
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
I go places without you. Get things done...
There! Happy? I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise. Now look what you've done!
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
It's okay. We okay... a little codependent, sure, but... Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them? They're lunatics.
The house is rented in your name.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
Um, well... technically, no. Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD.
Could be worse... Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
...your sentences! They're our sentences. Get your mind around that. Tyler gets up walks to Jack.
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants? We both use that body.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Maybe. Maybe a couple of guys with shaved heads couldn't synchronize their watches. Good riddance. Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his face. He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.
I wouldn't be doing that. Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones. Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.
This is not about martyrdom. Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.
Green? Did you say green? Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look, seems genuinely concerned.
Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire.
I'm serious. That's the wrong one. Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers trembling. The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...
Hear that? Marla's here. Just in the nick of time, eh? Jack looks to Tyler. Tyler points towards the SOUND...
See for yourself. Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand, keeps an eye on Tyler. Jack looks over the railing... BELOW, a BUS idles. The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out, kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...
I've got everything. The bombs. The army. I've got Marla.
Bob was a grown man. In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name? Project ""Mayhem.""
You want out?
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons. You need to get with the program. (looks at his watch) Seven minutes. Let's get out of here. Tyler's walks away. Jack looks at the gun in his hand. He points the gun at Tyler...
(still walking away) What?
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb?
I did that for you. As a gesture. Now, how fast can you run? There are ten other bombs, in ten other buildings in the immediate area. If you're going to get them all, you better get cracking. (looks at watch) Six minutes. Green wires, remember. I'll be upstairs. Jack's stunned. Tyler walks across the parking garage, past Jack, heading for the STAIRS. Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES! Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding... Tyler spins to face Jack.
Whoa! What was that all about? Jack aims... FIRES! Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE. Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the post... Tyler is NOT THERE. Jack turns, takes slow steps, moving the gun from side to side... Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face. Jack falls. The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor... Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE. Jack looks to the gun, scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun... Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling. Jack rolls, holding his chest. He looks up, sees Tyler run into the STAIRWELL. Jack grabs the gun and follows...
Fire at will. Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler. Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect. Tyler raises his arms.
What did you expect? Jack charges. Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of Jack's hand. They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking each other to the floor...
One minute.
(looking out window) This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
It's getting exciting now. Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.
Look what we've accomplished. (checks watch) Thirty seconds. (looks out windows) Out these windows, we will view the economic collapse. One step closer to global equilibrium. I'm glad you're here with me. Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.
It's out of our hands. (looks at watch) This is it.
Fifteen seconds now. Can you see alright? 10... 9... 8.... Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS, excited. Jack closes his eyes, despairing.
What the fuck -- ?
What?
Damn it! God-damn it...
Do we have to do everything ourselves?! Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust. He reaches into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.
(into WALKIE TALKIE) ... Codename Rooster. Passcode First Strike... Jack's eyes go wide.
(into WALKIE TALKIE) Proceed with remote detonation. Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler. The GUN is knocked away. Jack STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles off... Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it. Tyler's getting to his feet, sees the gun, annoyed. Jack stands.
Haven't we already done this? Jack SHOOTS TWICE. Bullets pass right thorough Tyler. Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination. Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet. There's no walkie- talkie there. Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE CRUSHED under his own foot.
Why what?
You need me.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that. (pause) I'm not blind to my own failings...
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
I'm doing this for us.
(sullen) If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You will. You know you will. Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head. He looks at the gun in his hand...
Can you live with that? Jack stares at the gun a long time... then... Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH. Tyler cocks his head.
What are you doing?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
This is interesting. Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands very close to Jack.
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
I can see you feel very strongly. I feel strongly too. (pause) Hey, you and me. (pause) Friends again? Their eyes are locked, unblinking. Long silence.
What?
What?
What?
What's that smell... ? Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls... Tyler hits the ground. The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain. Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room, moving forward to Jack. TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.
","This is cancer, right? Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.
Slide.
Sure.
What?
And I saw you practicing this...
Telling me off. Is it going as well as you hoped... ? (reads his nametag) ""... Mr. Taylor.""
Go ahead. I'll expose you.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
A year? How'd you manage that?
Why do you do it?
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
Really? Jack sighs, then pulls back.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you. You still have your balls.
I don't know -- am I? Jack follow Marla into...
I'll take the parasites.
I want brain parasites.
I want that.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
(for the Clerk to hear) Yes, I'm selling some chothes. The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer.
That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Deal. They shake. Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.
Looks like this is goodbye.
How's this for not making a big thing? Jack watches her go. A moment, then he follows after...
Should we?
I suppose. Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the back, hands it to her. She takes the pen, grabs his hand and writes her number on his palm. She walks into the street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING. She turns, holds up the card.
It doesn't have your name. Who are you? Cornelius? Mr. Taylor? Dr. Zaius? Any of the stupid names you give each night? Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud. Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving. A BUS moves into view, obscuring her.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.
You haven't been going to yours.
Really?
Like testicular cancer?
I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Me too. I got a stomach full of Xanax. I took what was left of a bottle. Might've been too much. Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death? Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the hook, walks out the back door.
I can hardly believe anything about last night. Marla goes to pour coffee. She takes a swig, GARGLES and SPITS it in the sink. She gives Jack a lascivious smile.
What... ?
Fuck you. Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out. Jack gets up, watches her stomp away. Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after Marla. He's in his usual sweatpants. He grins at Jack, then moves away, pours himself coffee. Jack, smoldering, slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest. Tyler puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.
You got here fast. She staggers and sits on the bed. She slides off, along with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.
The mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic. She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.
Did I call you? Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO lying atop a dresser. Marla follows his gaze.
Don't worry. It's not a threat to you. SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.
Oh, no! Somebody called the cops... She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.
(pointing) End of the hall. The rescuers keep running.
(calling after) The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl, but she's lost faith in herself...
She's a monster! Infectious human waste! Good luck trying to save her!
If I fall asleep, I'm done for. You're gonna have to keep me up all night.
(whispering) I want to have your abortion.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
(seductive) It's a bridesmaid's dress. Someone loved it intensely for one day, then tossed it. Like a Christmas tree -- so special, then, bam -- it's abandoned on the side of the road, tinsel still clinging to it... Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses against the counter. Marla pulls her hemline further up.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
You can borrow it sometime. Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing. Marla blows smoke in his face. Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the sink. Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.
Don't worry, I'm leaving. Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes. She moves up into Jack's face.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast. I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Please.
Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any?
Good. He stares at her while she eats.
What happened to your hand? Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
Make sure.
You feel nothing?
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
I wish I could return the favor. Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.
I could check your prostate.
(pause) Well... thanks, anyway. Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than just friendly. Jack pulls away.
Yeah, we're done. See you around.
I'll be out of your way in a sec. She seems to be as weak as Jack.
Whatever.
Chloe's dead.
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part. Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face. There's a BRUISE on her ARM. Jack gets up, moves closer.
What do you get out of it? Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING. Jack can't quite figure where it's coming from.
Hear what?
Have we been talking too long? Must we change the subject? Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door, Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
Nothing? I don't think so.
What is this? Who did this?
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
You're afraid to say. Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with frustration. She leaves out the back door, not looking back. Jack leans against the wall. After a moment, he opens the basement door, heads downstairs...
Can I come in?
What?
Yeah?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is this a trick?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Is that what you're calling it?
You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole! Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
What is wrong with you?
What... ?
Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden, you fucking freak. What's going on? I'm coming over there...
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom. I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye. The stink was unbelievable.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. Marla heads into a DINER. Jack follows...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I've done you enough favors. A WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table.
Why is it free of charge?
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie. Jack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces.
You got about thirty seconds.
Two sides? You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
What?
Whatever. (to waiter) I'll take my food to go... Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her by the arm, putting her back in her seat.
What?
You are an insane person.
No, no, shut up! I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried... Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore. I just can't. This is killing me...
What?! You're sorry? I don't believe that for a minute. Marla gets up. Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading for the door. Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...
Let go of me!
Leave me alone! I don't ever want to see you again!
Tyler...
Why are you doing this?
(holds up the money) I'm not paying this back. I consider it ""asshole tax.""
Tyler... Jack finally looks to her.
You are the worst thing that ever happened to me. DOORS HISS SHUT. The BUS LEAVES, heading away. Jack seems relieved. Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA... Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys. Jack SPRINTS after the bus... The bus speeds away. Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla. Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.
You motherfuckers... They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE. Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
","We're still men.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid. Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.
Okay. You cry now. Jack looks at Bob.
...using steroids. I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake. Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Go ahead, Cornelius. You can cry. They look at each other. Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.
Cornelius! How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
No. I found something new.
(quietly) The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
You are?!
That's a fucking great, man! Fucking great! Congratulations.
You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution. They say he only sleeps one hour a night. You know about this guy? Tyler Durden?
Thank you. Thank you. Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.
Shhhh, wait... they're back to it... Bob goes to turn up the TV. One guy, sixteen years old with an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.
Shhhhh! Watch! Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the ""PARKER MORRIS BUILDING."" The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.
The first rule of Project Mayhem is... you do not ask questions. Jack stares at them.
Man, his balls are ice cold. Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles. Jacobs is bug-eyed. Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.
","Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us. Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:
I look around this room and I see a lot of courage. And it gives me strength. We give each other strength. Jack looks around. Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing. Jack squirms in his seat.
It's time for the one-on-one. Let's follow Thomas's example and open ourselves. Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off. Jack stands, uncomfortable.
Can everyone find a partner? Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack, shuffling his feet.
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
...And you open the door and you step inside. We're inside our hearts. Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light. That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light. Jack, eyes closed, is silent...
It moves over your body, healing you. Keep this going and step forward, through the back door of the room. Where does it lead? To your cave. Step forward into your cave.
Okay, everyone. Everyone sits in chairs. Jack catches sight of Marla.
To open tonight's communion, Chloe would like to say a few words. Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin stretches yellowish and tight over her bones. She wears a head bondage. She clears her throat.
Thank you, Chloe. Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
Now, you're standing at the entrance to your cave. You step inside your cave and you walk. Keep walking. Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.
Now, find your power animal.
Pick someone special to you tonight. Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him. He tries to smile. She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.
Tell the other person how you feel.
Share yourself completely. Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were crying. Jack pulls her head back up. She deadpans at him.
Let yourself cry.
Quietly, now. Share with each other. Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.
Now, the closing prayer.
