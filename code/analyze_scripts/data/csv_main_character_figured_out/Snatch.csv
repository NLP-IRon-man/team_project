txt,"It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy, not a tickling competition. These lads are out to hurt each other.
What do I look like to you George, a fuckin water boy? Turkish looks at the WATER BOY.
Oi son, look lively. He turns .back to Tommy.
Look at it. He turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep the training gear and administration for the fights
How am I supposed to run this thing from that? We gonna need a proper office. He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful
I want a new one Tommy and you 're going to buy it for me.
Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's just I am not sure about the colour. He passes him a piece of paper
Here it's all arranged. You just gotta pick it up. Here's an address. Tommy looks at the address and frowns.
That's right, you're buying a caravan, caravans live in campsites.
I don't know what they are, all I know is they have a caravan, and we want a Caravan.
You're a sensitive boy, ain't you Tommy? You got ten grand and I want to see change.He is distracted by the bulge in Tommy's trouser front.
Fuck me, hold tight, what's that?
No Tommy, there's a gun in your trousers. What is a gun doing in your trousers?
Protection from what, the Germans? The war ended fifty years ago. Err what's to stop it blowing your balls off every time you sit down? Where did you get it?Looking down onto his gun.
You mean Boris the sneaky fucking Russian.Turkish pulls the gun out of Tommy's front.
I t ' s a bit heavy isn't it? H e spins the chamber
What were you thinking of? Why the fuck did you put Gorgeous George into a bare knuckle boxing match two days before he had to fight the Bomber?
You put the man into a bare knuckle boxing match. He raises his voice
What the fuck did you expect? A grease down and a shiatsu?
You took the fuckin jam out of my donut Tommy, you did.
Tell me the correlation between a hospitalized boxer and a good deal? Pause there is no correlation as Tommy knows.
How are we going to explain to Brick Top that his fight isn't going to . happen?
Oh what, and hope he doesn't notice? And who the fuck are we going to replace him with?
You're not exactly Mr Current Affairs, are you Tommy? Mad Fist went mad, and the ""Gun"" shot himself.
Got his fingers caught in the till. He's no good to anyone.
A bare .knuckle boxer isn't a lot of good without any fuckin knuckles, Tommy. Pause for thought, then Turkish has the look of a man that has come across a really bright idea.
Jesus!
Let's use the fuckin pikey.
What do you say?
A what?
We are here to see Brick Top. The barman looks them up and down a bit. He's not doing anything.
Brick Top.
You know what he's done to people on that pool table? They both give the table an eyeball.
Quite a fuckin lot if you nail 'em to it. TWO HEAVY LOOKING FELLAS appear out of the woodwork.
Yup. -
They can charm the paint off walls these fellas.
I like my dog to growl at the post man.
We don'c have a Gorgeous anymore. Brick Top turns round and indicates that he would like the noise around him to drop. It does marginally.
We have lost Gorgeous George. Brick Top turns round again at the already subdued crowd, he doesn't raise his voice but the crowd reacts.
I am not backing out.
You won't know him. Pause: a look of you're kidding comes over his face.
No, there was an accident.
You've still got your fight.
So Michael, you got it clear? It's the fourth round. I'll tap you anyway to let you know when to go down.
I ain't going in the front.
Unless you are going to transcendentally extract the passports and cash from out of a steel safe, I can't see any other way of getting them. Keep your eyes peeled. Turkish has another look around the back
Well I can't see anyone. After I have got in go round the front and call me if you see anything.
Shit you scared the life outta me.
What brings you two here, run out of pants to sniff?
Well what do you want?
Help yourself. You have to every thing else.
Brick Top.
You want sugar?
If I turn my back am I going to get a hole through it?
Of course.
Where did they come from? You're a snake in the grass Tommy.
'Do you know where I can find him?
Well would you like to share that information with me Ms O'Neill?
Hare coursing. The gypsies can't get enough of it.
I t ' s a big rabbit.
Because they call em hares. Tommy shrugs.
They set two lurchers, they are dogs before you ask, on a hare, that's the big rabbit. And the hare has to outrun the dogs.
Well the big rabbit gets fucked doesn't it?
Yeah before the Germans get there Tommy. How can a dog fuck a rabbit?...eh? If eats the bastard.
Well do you want to do it?
On what?
That's not the same caravan.
I t ' s twice the fuckin size of the last one.
Micky you are lucky we aren't worm food after your performance, I think buying a tart's mobile palace is a little fuckin rich. There is a pause while Micky frowns. Turkish looks a little sheepish.
I didn't mean that your mum was a tart. I just meant...
What like Tommy did last time? Do me a favour?
Okay, I reckon the hare gets caught. But he's in. Gypsy Romany Music starts. Cut to slow motion, CU of dogs' enthusiasm, CU of pikeys and their fingers skillfully dealing in money, inhaling cigarettes, etc.
We buy him a caravan Tommy.
Why didn't you ""bus a cap in his ass"" then Tommy? Mind you, you would do more damage if you threw it at him.
Oh no Tommy I wasn't saying you can't shoot, I know you can't shoot. What I was saying is that six pound piece of shit stuck in your trousers there would do more damage if you fed it to em.
You tried it? Tommy frowns
Whoops.
I am sorry, but he's a stubborn bastard, he says he's had enough, he says he's got to look after his old mum.
That's what he said, she's a nice old girl his mum.
Jesus I am sorry Micky. I am really sorry. He's a mad bastard. Darren decides to interject.
Why?
I gotta say .1 don't like this Tommy. This has got very fuckin messy. Jesus you know how he felt about his old girl. I think we should get you a new gun Tommy, but this time try . . . '. it.
We'll be there in a minute. He takes a sip of his milk. There's a pause.
It's not the same.
Milk, in these cartons. i
Why, what's wrong with it?
Shut up!
Well fuck me Tommy, what have you been reading?
Cows mad as lorries eh? You hear about the two cows having a chat in a field? One says to the other, ""what do you think about this mad cows' disease then? The other one looks back and says ""doesn't bother me, I'm a duck. Turkish looks back at him blankly.
He's left the door open.
I don't want to go in there, he's a dangerous bastard, taken too many disco biscuits in the heat of Russian disputations, he's got as many of these nuts as those nuts. He grabs his groin and circles his finger and his temple
Well come on then before the Germans get here.
Oi Micky. Oi Micky.
You feeling alright Micky?
We are nearly there. They are a horrible bunch this lot Micky so pay attention to what you are doing. Micky just yawns.
Put up some kind of a show, he's a hard bastard this ""good night"" Anderson so don't get too clever, he used to be a pro. Just keep moving round the ring, and let the odd one go when push has come to shove.
Of course he knows when he's going down.
Fuck face? I like that, I ' l l have to use that one next time -I want to impress your mum Ken.
I don't like the look of this Tommy, bring the van up to the back door. This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him back to his corner.
They are on ya. You got to hurt him Micky. Otherwise we are rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do -something, it looks like it' s rigged. Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low, BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.
Tommy get the van.
We are off Micky, hold tight, and move quickly. , Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his mobile telephone. It rings.
I can't say I have Micky.
","It's a mosinite.
No, a mosinite.
No, a fuckin mosinite. It's the updated zirconia.
Zirconias are artificial diamonds, they look pretty good to the novice like you Lincoln. But you could break them with a hammer, so they came up with mosinites.
I am saying it's worth fuck all. Lincoln's face drops
What's that Vince?
I know full fucking well what it is Vin. Where did you get it?
It better not be dangerous.
Yes, it fucking does Vin. If it so much as farts it's out.
Boris, what's up?
Go on.
How high do you want us to hold it? Steady on George. We deal in jewellery Boris, we don't hold up bookies. We can hear Vinny in the background
Give him another of those biscuits. They shut him up.
No Vin, he can't tell the difference between a steering wheel and a man . on the moon. That' s why I got him. Sol gives the dog another biscuit.
I don't know Vin. Oi Tyrone, Vin wants to know why you talk like a black man?
I don't know. You get that gun from Boris?
What's that?
I t ' s a fuckin anti-aircraft gun Vin. What are you planning on shooting, the angels out of the clouds? That's gonna raise more than pulses.
I don't think I really want to see Â· hell Vin. What's wrong with a normal gun?
Can you get this fuckin dog to stop dribbling on me? Vin pulls the dog back.
I worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk about overkill. One look at a crack desperate brother and you could wave a knife and fork around, and I am sure they would lick the salt of your scrotum. The car wash starts.
I am not happy about that dog Vin, you can't bring a dog on a job.
Homesick, for fucks sake.
Ohh shut up, how can he find it?
You're going soft Vin? Here pass me a sandwich. Vin throws a sandwich to Sol but the dog catches it whilst i t ' s in flight and swallows it in one gulp.
Jessssus, he didn't even chew it. The car has stopped.
Leave him alone, he's a natural. Tyrone gets a little over-excited with the accelerator and reverses with a crashing sound into the rear of the van behin them (ie it:s parked back to back with them).
He can't swallow a whole ball.
He'll probably cough it up.
Hope not.
We are waiting for a man carrying a case.
Because the deal is that we give the Russian the case and we keep the money. He rubs his fingers symbolically together
Fuckin 'ell Tyrone you ask a lot of questions. You concentrate on the driving okay? He turns back just as a MAN is stepping into the bookies: he is carrying a case.
Shit, was that him?
Are you serious? I am sorry but I couldn't get the binoculars out in time.
Vi nce ? Vince?? He spins round looking for his colleague. A muffled noise tells him to look up. ,
I have got your man out here. If you don't put down the screen I'll blow his fucking head off! You hear me?
You think you can try me?
Drop the screen now! You just seen what it did to this wall so think what it could do to you. Pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely scared.
How you doing Vince? A weakened voice retorts.
Now fill this bag. . . ' . - . -
I am not here to make a fuckin bet.
Are you fuckin stupid? I don't care if the fuckin bets are off. I want...
I ain't buying that.
Well, what have you got?
Well I am not feeling too fucking funny myself, let me tell you! Sol points at the man on the floor who is carrying the case.
Let me see your hands. The man holds his hands up. He has got a perfect set of five fingers on both hands. Sol puts his head in his hands. Pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on the counter. Sol picks them up and frowns, he's not happy with a bag full of change. He puts his gun down and starts to rifle through the bag. Pauline can see Vinny's pistol on the counter, dropped after his encounter with the screen.
We're going Vin. He grabs the bag of copper coins, grabs Vince and marches towards the double'doors. They open the first set and then they try to open the second. They push the door nothing happens. There is no going back. Sol starts to kick the glass door, but it doesn't budge. With panic rising swiftly, Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors shattering bullet-proof glass all around them. Vinny's panic filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. Sol is unaware of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol fires another bullet. Now he observes the problem and waits for the inevitable. The bullet tears through the bag of coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's feet. Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh. Sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. Amongst the yells emanating from Vince we can hear Sol's pathetic and desperate whimpering.
No security, eh? At that point Tyrone appears and pushes the door open. The door was open the whole time - only Sol was pushing it the
Tyrone get us outta here. Tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van (ie Franky) seeing that he's carrying a case and the case is connected to his wrist.
I said, get us outta here Tyrone!
Where ' s the Russian?
What do you need the tape off your eyes for? You talk out of them?
Come on. He opens it - and it's got about a grand inside.
The case was attached to his body.
The only man that knows the combination you just shot. Boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four foot machete that he was concealing about his person. He pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with full force. We can tell by the expression on Tyrone's face that it must have been some part of Franky's anatomy. Pointing to the ground:
He got shot in the face Lincoln, I would have thought that was obvious.
Sort it out.
Villains are supposed to know how to get rid of bodies.
He's a man with a hole in his face Lincoln. Who cares who he is?
What do you want to do that for? , He's not a fuckin Christmas present.
Hold him by his legs.
Would someone mind telling me who you are?
Mr Mclean I kid you not. Why do you think we have a dead man, missing an arm in our office? Give us four days and we'11 bring you a stone the size of a home. Brick Top considers this, and has a look at Errol who is more than enthusiastic to get on with the job at hand.
First things first, one of us, Tyrone, you get round to-the Russian's. The second you see him call us.
I am on it Tyrone^.
It's the Russian, well to be technical an Uzbekistan.
Boris. BTT looks familiar with this name.
Lincoln's got some tools here, when he has had a few drinks he gets em out and runs around the house holding a pistol in each hand, telling me about what a bad boy he is.
Well they ain't gonna be lying on the kitchen table Vince, we gotta have to look. Flick tlie switch. I t ' s dark, they flick the switch. They look onto an immaculate pad. Music fades up along with the lights.
He likes his drum does Bad Boy Lincoln. The dog goes bounding in.
Well let's get busy.
I didn't know did I? They always looked the shit to me.
Shut your mouth Vince, this is all we got, so this will have to do. Sol's mobile rings.
Yes?
Now.
We're coming over. Hold him there. Sol puts the phone down before he has to hear what Tyrone has to say.
Leave that dog here Vince, we gotta * go. They shut the dog in the main room and go out of Lincoln's house.
Where is he?
Why didn't you tell us Tyrone? Tyrone pulls a ""I tried"" face.
No I don't Tyrone, but I do know I don't want to be eaten by pulled apart by dogs and then eaten by fuckin pigs.
Not so fast Vin we can't get em now we gonna have to follow them. B TT's car moves off. The black guys follow.
OK is very close to KO, and KO is close to R.I fucking.P. You know what RIP stands for Tyrone?
It stands for .shut your fuckin mouth Tyrone and leave the talking to us. Let's get these ready.
Jesus, I didn't know it was that loud.
You wanted to see if they worked.
Well they work, I reckon they are really going to put the shits into em.
Is that Boris?
Let's hit em now.
Well you better start thinking Vince because otherwise you'll be fuckin lucky if you end up looking like that.
They are getting out.
When we get in you wait by the door I am number one, Vin number two and you are number three.
I don't want a fuss and I don't want to put a bullet in your face, but unless you give me exactly what I want there will be murders. BTT shakes his head in amazement.
Number three pull the blind down. Tyrone can't hear this request.
Stand up!
You hear what .1 said? Stand up, unless you're crippled.
You'll look fucking dead, unless you stand up. Sol cocks the gun and Tony pulls a sarcastic 'I am shocked' face.
You want to test em?
Let go of the gun. Vinny cocks his gun. There is a pause and eventually Tony lets go of it.
Any chance of taking Lincoln with us?
You alright Lincoln?
Err .
What?
What choice did we have?
Why should we? Could just have disappeared. Cut to Hands who's thinking.
You what?
Yes but Doug the fuckin head does!
Ohh your one clever bastard Vin, you really are. Where is it?
What happen if they find that it's a fake stone Vince?
He's not fuckin about, we left it there. It must be in the dog. All eyes focus on the dog.
Well this is where they were.
","You can call me Susan if it makes you happy.
You don't, you should comb em some time.
Well then it depends on all the elements in the equation, how many, are there?
Where was he last seen?
A bookies eh? Susi, pass us the blower. Susi reaches for the phone.
A bookies got blagged last night.
Robbed. I gotta see a man who looks like he might know something, but it can't be done on the phone if you know what I mean. He turns to Rose Bud.
No you don't, Rose Bud my old son, you need me.
Alright Mullet?
This job does have prospects after all, you travel to pretty places, meet interesting people. Btt looks at who Mullet is talking to, the man has a try hard mustache and interjects.
Someone whom you might shortly meet.
Only with wings and a halo. Mullet gives the man a furtive kick and makes eyes to shut up. ,
Clean the breakfast7off your top lip/ and make yourself busy sunshine. The man moves off
I want to know who blagged Brick Top's bookies.
I will do you a favour Mullet, I'll not bash the living fuck out of you in front of all your girlfriends here.
If you play hard to get 'Mullet you'll wish you'd never been caught. Mullet looks uncomfor'table about the fact that he's thinking.j ' Â· Â· Â·
Give us your wallet Hands. Hands makes eyes and digs into his back pocket and produces his wallet. BTT takes out some notes and proffers them to Mullet, Mullet nervously reaches forward. As quick as you like Btt has Mullet by the collar and pulls Mullet into the car. He then raises the electric window on Mullet's throat until it has fastened Mullet to the roof of the vehicle.
Comfortable Mullet? , Mullet has already gone pink.
You can take as long as you like Mullet. Btt starts to pull away so Mullet has to keep walking with him.
I am driving down the street with your head stuck in my window. What do you think I am doing you penis? He does the window up a bit tighter. And grabs him by the nose. He pulls a face when he smells his breath.
You been using dog shit tooth paste Mullet? He speeds up even more.
Oh I love this track. Yes Mullet.
Tyrone Conway?
Tyrone Conway?
It may be fuckin him, but wait and see what I can do to you. He puts his foot down and Mullet loses his footing, and is dragged along. '.
Dear oh dear, you do know some horrible people.
Sneaky little shit one of the Russian dissidents, killed more men than,...well he's-killed a lot of men. Deals in arms, that he gets off some of the old school. We cut to the security monitor that observes the shop, it sits on Doug's desk. The door opens and in walks Boris. As bold as brass he walks up to the counter.
He's a bit sneaky this fella, so watch out.
He's all yours Rose Bud.
What do you want me to do? Your man there thought he could take him. I told you he was dangerous.
You want him to be able to talk or not?
You want to shoot him?
Well you want to stab him?
You want to kill him or not?
That's the spirit. There's a sword back there. He points to behind a seat: there is a bloody great sword concealed. Tony skillfully passes the sword to Rose Budd, who attempts to pull it out of its scabbard. Tony turns round to Hands.
You, you want a knife? He passes Hands a knife.
It's not a fuckin rocket launcher. It's a knife for gods sake, what have you used for to keep your fork company for all these years? It's got a sharp side and a blunt side. You want a lesson? There is a sudden bang on the windshield and BTT turns back to the front only to see the windshield covered in milk. Tony can't see where he is going and searches for the windshield wipers. While this is happening the car swerves to the side and hits a lamp post. They crash and the boot (trunk) has flown open and Boris the Blade tries to lift himself out. Rose Bud looks down at the sword he has been extracting he can see he very nearly cut himself in two. Tony pulls himself up from the steering wheel he has a trickle of blood running down his face. There's a crash and a car hits em from behind.
We hit something and something hit us. He turns and sees that Rose Bud has got a sword sticking though him. It's gone through him and the seat that he is sitting on.
You alright?
I mean do you feel alright?
Hold tight big man, and put your guns away. Let's get going.
Well you can bring him with you if you want but which bit do you want to bring?
Doug, we are in the shit, come and pick us up.
Excuse me, but who the fuck are you?
Do I look crippled? ,
You got ballsl
There are two types of balls, there are big brave balls and there are little mincy faggot balls.
I am talking for your benefit. Now dicks have drive, and clarity of vision. Tony starts to build himself a complicated looking weapon under the table, unseen by the black guys. He takes bits out of one sock and bits out of another sock.
But they're not clever, they smell pussy, and they want a piece of the action, and the dimmer the dick, the less he cares about the consequences, and you thought you smelt gooood ol pussy, and have brought your little mincy faggot balls along for a gooood ol time, but you have got your parties muddled up, there is no pussy here, just a dose to make you wish you were born a woman.. . . We cut to the shell shocked brothers, and the almost completely built weapon.
And just like a prick, you are having second thoughts; you're shrinking, and your little balls are shrinking with you. They stare on. The brothers have lost this one and they know it. They start to reverse. BTT lets the odd chicken cluck out the corner of his mouth, Vinny misses his step and waves his gun about in a futile effort to look mean. They back away into the corridor down to the back door of the cf. . . ae Â·
Well you gotta admire their balls.
So Brick Top has now got the stone?
Never mind what I got , I am looking for Brick Top?
You know who I mean you fucking fringe now find him. Pause: the barman looks truculent.
Chop chop. The barman walks down the end of a bar and picks up the phone.
I had a little run in with a few of the chaps.
They're all brainless, they got white powdered angels sitting on their shoulders telling them what was what, all too busy. . .
If they weren't sniffing the dust they where flicking the ash. And never trust who puts anything other than a finger up his nose. KEN, another of Brick Top's men, appears from somewhere and approaches Tony with another heavy, SEAN.
Yes I know I stabbed a man called Lorrie, but no I didn't know he was related to a tub a shit. Ken knows it's on.
Lock that fuckin door Sean. BTT takes a step forward and puts his hand, into the back of his trousers. He starts to growl.
You're a big man, but I don't care if you're ten foot fuckin tall, you still got eight pints of blood and you'll bleed like any bastard. And . when.I drop .ya, and I will fuckin drop ya, I'll open you up like a packet of crisps. Pause to take in what has just been said then he continues.
You're a bully Ken, but remember, I am a bigger bully.
You gotta diamond and it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to my colleague here.
I said we should come round and raise fuckin hell, you know shoot a few of the boys and that, but he said he thinks we would have more success if we paid for it. So I am going to have a drink and let you two discuss what you have to discuss. Btt walks to the bar. Ken is sitting there with Sean.
Alright big man, I hope you aren't bitter about your cousin Lorrie. If you listen carefully, you will hear a slight zip of flies being undone.
Ohh yes you are going to get fucked Vince. -
Veeeery nice Lincoln.
Well where is it?
It's a bit funky in here. BTT opens a window. The dog looks extremely relieved to see someone.
Dear oh dear.
What?
I t ' s not a fuckin tin of baked beans, what do you mean open him up?
That's a bit strong isn't it?
But it's not, it's a dog and I have never done a dog.
Fuckin hell, alright then.
I t ' s squeaking.
Yeah bollocks.
","Move it, come on move"" i t . Vinny enters the pawn shop.
Alright Sol, Lincoln. They are in deep discussion and only Lincoln responds.
We have told you before Lincoln, you Â· stick to being a gangster and leave this game to me and Sol. Sol looks round properly at Vin and can see that he's accompanied by a dog. '
Err, it's a dog Sol.
It's in here, what's the problem, it's only a dog.
Those gypsies, they threw it in with a load of moody gold. Sol considers this and decides it can't be all bad.
Does it look dangerous?
If it farts we'll all be out.
Jesus, where did you come from?
Oi Sol, Boris is here.
They give him wind. Tyrone turns round to complain, and narrowly misses a car.
Hey watch the road! Fuck me, you want this man to drive us Sol? Can you drive mate?
Sol why's he talking like a black man?
Roots and what?
Got it. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, mind. Mean looking bastard though, that's for sure. Sol unzips a bag. Inside is a ridiculously powerful shotgun.
It's a shotgun Sol.
It will raise hell my old son.
The are psychological advantages to a gun that looks like it can perforate the moon.
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you serious,? You' re a getaway driver, you're not here to show your fuckin car off. Â·Â·. The machine starts. They do the windows up and that point the dog lets out a fart. The water starts to hit the windshield so they can't undo the windows. There is more an atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger.
You can't leave him on his own, not to begin with, he gets homesick.
He does. If he gets the chance he runs back to the gypsies' campsite.
I don't know Sol, I am not a dog. Ask him. It' s like he's got a fuckin homing beacon. Give him the chance and he's off.
What have you stopped here for? What's wrong with that space?
What are you talking about, tight? You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in there.
A natural fuckin idiot. Tyrone, what have you done?
Well don't move it now, otherwise people will see the damage. What did you do that for? ^
Eh? It's a four ton truck. It' s not as though i t ' s a ferret fuckin a flea is it?
Funny angle? It was behind you Tyrone, whenever you reverse things come from behind you. I am not happy Sol. - The dog starts whining.
Give him something to shut him up. Sol throws a plastic squeaky dog ball that was in the front. The dog grabs in and swallows it in one gulp. The brothers look on in shock.
How am I going to get it out?
Do you think he'll be alright? Sol shrugs.
Well let's not stand on ceremony, let's start the show. They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving Tyrone in the van. There's a double set of glass doors. Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol hangs back with the shotgun.
You can start by giving me all your money.
It. belongs to me now. Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing. Pauline looks more than a little concerned
If you know what's good for... He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid rate of knots protecting all the counters. This has the unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needless to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on the ceiling. Sol extracts the enormous shotgun.
How do I look like I am doing you fucking idiot? I would be doing a lot better if you would stop using my name. Consoled that his colleague is not dead it's back to business for Sol. He raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face.
Can we just get out of here please. I am not feeling too funny. Sol's temper does have a limit.
He should be here in a minute. Well get him to open it. Vinny turns to Franky who has tape over his eyes.
Oi, you, Four Fingers, how are we going to get into your case?
You look at us and it's good night. Vinny takes it off. Franky blinks at the revelation of light. And gets busy opening the case .
And?
I don't believe this. Why are you carrying round a case with this little in it? . . Vin turns to Sol and Tyrone who is leaning on the big shotgun At which point Franky pulls out the gun from the secret compartment in the case.
Err, because we didn't. Now Boris we have or rather you have a problem.
Keep it. We want this, or at least half of this.
I am afraid it's too late for that Boris. - He holds up the diamond. Boris1 eyes follow him as he walks back into the room where Franky is and puts the diamond back into the case while he's talking and changes the combination.
We want half and that's because we are being generous. We could by rights keep the whole fuckin stone. Boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where, and within a second shoots poor Franky in the face. Franky's body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on. The black guys are stunned into silence.
Well I don't.
Lincoln, who is this man?
Well thank you, that's a large weight off my mind.
But would you mind very much telling me who the' fuck you are? Other than a man that feeds people to pigs of course. The door opens and we see John, who is wearing a pair of extremely large plastic gloves, showing Brick Top the shotgu that he has found.
No wonder that sneaky fuckin Russian didn't want to do it.
Do you know where he keeps em? They find the right key.
Jesus. What's going on here?
What are we gonna do with em Sol?
Do they look hard?
. They're replicas.
Well come on let's have em. Pause while they consider this.
Well come on.
How do you know? They're replicas, what do you know about replicas? Sol looks at the gun and frowns, ""what does he know about replicas""? He pulls the trigger. He fires one shot. It is very loud, the gun goes off near Tyrone's ear, he buckles in . pain. The car does a massive swerve and everything nearly ends in disaster, all the windows shatter including the windshield (but the glass stays put). Tyrone regains some control over the car.
Well just how fuckin loud did you think it was going to be? It's a- fucking gun Sol, guns are renowned for making a loud fucking noise whenever you pull the trigger.
I didn't mean try it in the fuckin car Sol.
Right now I am not concerned with putting the shits into em Sol, I am "" "" . concerned about taking the pain out of my ringing fucking ears. Look what you did to poor Tyrone. Tyrone you alright? He taps Tyrone on the shoulder. Tyrone looks up.
Are you alright? Tyrone spins in his seat and answers a little too loudly.
You idiot what have you done?
The is a dead Russian on my lap Sol I am not thinking about hitting anybody right now.
Well get down, the last thing we want him to see is three brothers wearing ski masks.
I'11 never forgive you Sol. Sol taps Tyrone on the shoulder.
lo number three, he said pull the blind down. He still can't hear him. This is minorly embarrassing.
I'll sort it. .
Pass it me. Hands hesitates.
Err. .
The gun you prick. Sol goes for one, and Vin goes for the other.
I know sorry doesn't mean fuck all, but we are game on, what do you want us to do?
He's got it.
I changed the stone.
I changed it. I know Brick Top knows nothing about stones.
Yeah well I didn't expect them to lock us up in here did I?
It's at Lincoln's.
Waiting for us to pick it up.
Well we are going to get fucked Sol what do you think is going to happen? The door opens.
Next door. They open the door.
It was over there. He points to a pile of chewed up cushions.
We left it in a box over there... somewhere. He walks over and finds the remains of the box.
I t ' s empty.
You can't do that.
Stop! I can see it. I can see the stone. Hands at the point of entry stops. Vinny hops over to the stone and picks it up. Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a grip oh the collar. The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated. Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare.
They can't be far.
There they are.
But he always came back.
Watch your mouth you cheeky shite.
","Twenty carats?
Good man Franky, you done a good job. What time you back?
Speak to my cousin Doug.
Yeah, Doug the Head. But get some security. I mean it, get it today, speak to those Russians, they can get you anything. And. . . Dramatic pause
No fuckin around in any casinos, you hear me? You've done a good job Franky, don't go and fuck it up.
He's got it.
Play the game Doug.
You gotta haggle fairly Doug, otherwise it'll make your hair fall out you'll see. .
He isn't selling poop.
Do shut up, where is he now?
When?
What do you mean a fight, you mean a boxing match? Is there gambling involved?
Did he have a case with him?
And he's gone gambling? That's Franky ""I have a problem with gambling"" fuckin Four Fingers, you are talking about Doug.
Franky is good at buying stones Doug but he's a fuckin liability when it comes to gambling. That has cost me. So in turn rit' s cost him. He gets distracted and chopping off a digit seems to focus his attention.
I ' l l not forgive you Doug, I am coming over, get me that car. The phone is slammed down.
...-.! gotta say it's not bad. He then looks at the sign of the rundown venue, his eyes squint incredulously.
Caesar's Palace?
Jesus are we ever going to get in there?
I am not looking for Vegas, Doug, I am looking for Franky Four Fingers.
If there's gambling involved, he'll be here. They get nudged aside by an entourage of men coming through.
Hello, who's your man? Hands points out Brick Top who is being crowded by minders.
Original.
They, have only made forty this year. You could find the maker of this engine's signature on the engine. But you can't find me Franky.
Who's he? Susi interrupts.
You really think he can find him?
Ok so let's get hold of him.
.He could swing from trees wearing rubber dresses as far as I am concerned, all as I care about is whether he can find Franky.
Can I call you Tony?
About forty thousand.
Blagged?
What about? He points to Mullet. BTT pulls an, 'oh yes I forgot about him1 face. He doesn't even look at Mullet. He lowers the window, and Mullet falls by the way, in god knows what condition.
Russian? The sneaky dogs. I been doing business with those sneaky dogs.
Russians, I didn't think it would be the Russians.
Sneaky was a bit of a fuckin understatement wasn't it?
How you doing Rosey?
We gotta get this stone first Rosy and then we'll get you to a hospital.
Take it easy Rosy, take it easy. BTT looks at the blood that's already starting to pierce the skin from where the blade is pressed against the Russian's neck. BTT then looks at Hands with concern.
He's a sneaky fucker that Russian. Well shall we go?
I want to bury him.
I t ' s a bit noisy isn't it?
I wouldn't know what to do with it.
What happened?
No I am about a rocket ride from right Tony.
Ohh yeah, I feel like I am lying on the naked lap of Aphrodite, cooled by the tumbling petals of spring roses, how the fuck do you think I feel?
What about Rose Bud?
I gotta clean up. He goes out the back while BTT goes to the pay phone to call Doug.
_ I don't want to admire balls that I want to chop off.
You wouldn't be lying to us would you now?
Okay.
What was it you did exactly Tony?
How ' s that ?
Well come on, let's have a look. Brick Top passes the stone to Hands. All goes quiet while everybody focuses on the stone. Hands lifts it up to his eye.
What are you playing at? - He drops the stone: it smashes on the ground.
It's a zirconia. We crash track in to Brick Top's expression of shock.
Very nice Lincoln.
You keep a good house Lincoln. So where's this stone?
Where?
Tony.
Well let's have a look shall we? . . . . Tn . oy All eyes focus on Tony.
Have a vlook in the dog.
I mean open him up.. Tony is not sure about this.
I mean open him up. Hands does a movement that represents a knife across the throat.
You wouldn't have a problem if it was a person.
My heart bleeds. There is another pause
Let me take a wild and reckless guess. Stick a knife in his guts and see if it's got a diamond in there? I'll hold it still and'you open it up. Tony looks positively unsure and rocks his head from side to side.
Well do it to you as well if it makes you feel any better. Cut to Tony having some problems trying to get hold of the awkward dog. The dog starts to squeak. Tony passes the blade to Hands.
What, you've never heard a dog squeak before?... Hold him still. The dog isn't sure about this either. Vin is in a panic and suddenly.
Well let's see it. Vinny holds it up. There's a sense of relief. He then throws the stone, it cuts through the air. And the dog seeing .another projectile runs to intercept it. There's a pause while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window launches itself out of it.
Well they aren't fuckin here now are they? And I can't see a dog can you?
You gonna have to come up with something. Just then they see some caravans in the distance.
Are you sure he's not here?
Do you mind if we have a look around?
You better find me that dog, skinny Vinny. One of Micky's kids is on the bottom of the caravan steps as the brothers walk by.
So?
