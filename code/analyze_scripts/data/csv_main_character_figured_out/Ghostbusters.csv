txt,"And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.
(irritated) Egon! The phone!
It sure feels strange not having Egon with us.
is jotting info on notepad.
Did it have any distinguishing marks?
No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here.
Then explain those!Ray points at ground. Peter, Winston and Slimer look down.
(excited) What'd I tell you, Peter? A werechicken egg! Gimme a hand, Winston!
(looking at meter in Peter's hand) I dunno... that is strange.
Oh no, I'm not leavin'. The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.
(holds up one hand) Shh!
(low voice) It's in there.
(whisper) Something's close. Very close.
Bad choice of words, Winston.THE WERECHICKEN suddenly leaps AT CAMERA.
Trap out!
We've almost got him!
(looking at chicken) Well, that takes care of one werechicken.
Peter, that is Egon! The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken!The door behind them is starting to splinter and bulge from the batteringof the Egon-Chicken.
It's the moon!He hurries o.s.
(turning to others) Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full.
(tentative) Egon?
(flipping through book) Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens! (reads) ""The werechicken appears during the full moon. Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken."" (he looks at Egon) That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...
(looking in Tobin's Guide) According to this, there is an antidote. But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes!
(reading through above) ""One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin...""
(reading hurriedly) ""And one tablespoon of chickenbane.""
Then we've gotta go with this! C'mon!They run OUT with the mixing bowl of liquid. Slimer follows.
(breathless) Quick, Egon, drink this!Winston hands the bowl of potion to Egon, who gulps it down.
The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane.
The werechicken that bit Egon. It's still out there somewhere.
Not a peep.
(to Winston) Let's split up.They run off in opposite directions, flanking the long aisles.
We didn't! Come on!They hurry o.s.
(into radio) On our way, Peter.Winston floors it and he and Ray accelerate forward INTO CAMERA.
Let's reel him in!
(SNAPS finger) Peter, that's not a bed idea! Chicken freezes at very low temperatures!
It looks like it's about to lay an --Winston puts a hand over Ray's mouth.
It came from the lab!The Ghostbusters burst from their chairs and run o.s.
","(sarcastic) Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself. (picks up phone) Ghostbusters Central.
Calm down... Where are you?... (a BEAT as he listens) We'll be right there.He hangs up.
Ready for this one? Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his? He'll be a rich man!
Shouldn't be hard to find.
A werechicken?
Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests. Then maybe we'll have some answers.
(tired) Ray, it's gettin' pretty late. Maybe there really isn't any...
(unclipping his blaster) Then let's get it!
Look out!Ray shines his flashlight toward the lofts. Its beam catches a couple ofstartled pigeons as they fly out the window, pinion feathers WHISTLING.
Man, he is ugly!
Hang on! That's it!
Ray, I just had a thought...Ray pauses to look around at Winston.
(looking toward door) What happened? He's so quiet all of a sudden.
You've been turned into a werechicken!
We're too late!
What was that?
(gives Ray a dirty look) No pun intended.
That's it!Winston cranks the wheel.
Ten feet tall?
How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken?
Thirty feet tall?
(loud) Trap's full! Somebody forgot to empty it!
Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August?A BEAT, then the three guys look at each other.
What's it doing?
(with dread) I don't want to hear it.
Uh-oh.
(big SIGH) It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James Brown tape.
","(pissed; sarcastic) Thanks, Slimer. I really needed that!
Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores. (he drops trash bags) Let's roll!Ray and Slimer also abandon their trash bags and EXIT with Peter andWinston.
(sarcastic) Why? Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us.
Good. Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.
Ray! It's six feet tall!Peter grabs Ray's arm, starts ushering him to front door.
(as they go) This one's easy, guys. Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn.
Get serious, Ray.
Look, if this is a werechicken egg,
(throws up his hands with heavy SIGH) I'll take it. C'mon, Slimer.They take egg from Ray and Winston and start back toward Ecto-l.
(through above) Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you: How about analyzing this?
I don't wanna hear about it, Egon. We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets.Peter EXITS as Slimer ZIPS in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin inhands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly. Egon pushes glasses up off tip ofnose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it. CAMERA MOVES IN onegg and we --
(startled YELL; then:) Slimer! How 'bout some privacy??
Monster?
Holy cow!!Peter raises his proton gun.
(horrified) What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!
(surprised as he looks around) Hey!
(irritated; through above) What's wrong with you guys? That thing ate Egon!
(looking at door) You're kidding! (a BEAT, then) Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance.Suddenly the battering stops.
Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken?
Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news.
(through above) Take it easy, Egon. You're gonna be fine. (SHOUTS O.S.; worried) Hurry it up, guys!
What happened?
Well, we hafta do something!
(to others) Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else! (to Egon) Un, no offense, Egon.The three normal Ghostbusters dash toward door.
(into radio mike) All quiet on the chicken front. How about down there?
(into mike) Ray, you were right! The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise!
(into radio) It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building.
Take over, Slimer!
So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys'
(loud over engine) Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons
(nods) Piece of cake.
Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!
(long-suffering) Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken outfit?
","shakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over Peter.
Sorreee!
(SNIFFS as he goes)
(amazed GASP!)
Yeah.Egon closes fridge.
(big YAWN) G'night, Egon.Slimer floats off.
Fooooood.He zips o.s.
(licking his lips) Yummy!Slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the eggdrives Slimer straight to the floor. The egg bounces on his stomach twicebefore he gets a grip on it. Straining his little green brains out, hefloats the egg up into the air and o.s.
(SQUEALS, then GRUNTS)
(HUMMING through above)
(still HUMMING)With a loud BANG, the oven practically explodes and the door flies off.Out pops a BABY WERECHICKEN, SNARLING and CACKLING.
(startled SCREAM)Slimer barrels up through sink faucet, leaving his bib stuck in theopening.
(pointing, eyes wide) Monster! Inna kitchen!
(nods) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! (imitates werechicken)
(SQUEALS as he goes)
(as he enters) Egon!
(aghast) No chickenbane!
(SQUEALS as he goes)
(covers mouth, LAUGHTER FIZZING through his closed, flapping lips. ""How absurd."")Suddenly, the head of the Werechicken rears up INTO SHOT right in front ofRay and Slimer.
Roger!Slimer grabs the control stick in both hands as Peter leans out to oneside with his blaster and fires downward.
(a la James Brown) I feel good! I knew that I would So good, so good, so good! (big James Brown HOWL as we --)
","(preoccupied; through above) Be with you in ... (checks watch) ...one minute, fifty-three seconds.
(preoccupied with remote controls) In a minute, Ray.
I think I've finally perfected it. Watch this, guys. (a BEAT, he looks around over shoulder) Guys?
Interesting. That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen.Peter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk.
(straining) Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't have time to examine this egg tonight. I have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning.
Goodnight, Slimer.
(looking around) Ow!
Ray, what is going on?
(as he sits) Bad news first.
A werechicken?
(through above) I remember the bite clearly. How long will I stay like this?ON RAY, WINSTON and PETERLooking at the Tobin Guide.
(weakly) I don't feel well.Peter steps INTO SHOT, puts arm around Egon's shoulders.
(swallowing, GULPING sounds)As Egon drinks, his arms transform into wings and he drops the bowl,breaking it.
Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter. There's a logical solution to every problem.
(startled CLUCK)Startled, Egon flutters up off the sill, gravity takes over, and he landson his feathered butt.
It's a long story, Janine. Can you get my coat, please? I'm due at the weather board in forty-five...
Trust me. I'm of sound mind at least.
(CLUCKING as he goes)
Distinguished members of the Weather Board, my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu- capability --
(to Board members) I, er, can explain this, but --Slimer flies INTO SHOT beside Egon and WHISPERS in his ear.
What?He looks around to where Slimer is pointing.
(holds up wings) Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.
Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position. Turn the lever to the extreme left.
(raising hand) You bet, Maude.
I'm actually starting to like it.
