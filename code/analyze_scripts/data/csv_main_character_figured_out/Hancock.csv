txt,"The principal did'nothing. Like schoolyard terrorism is no worse than being tardy. What's the matter with education? Back when, you could go to school and learn about Betsy Ross and... mollusks and... not get stabbed on the way home.

not listening .Lalalala...
Will you slow down.
I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.
Is my dress too tight?
Really, my waist isn't too big?
All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n't leave the building till then. I'll be there.
Give me a kiss, you snot.
Two-thirty.
(after him; in vain) You want anything from the store? He's gone.
You're sweet, Nick. He cracks a wet smile. Mary, aware, unhands the artichoke. Moves on.

I'm here to withdraw money. This stumps the brainless beast. And over by the teller, while he's stuffing her bag...
Tell me... what happened?
I was held up...
.at the bank. Honey, were they the same ones? Don't cry.
He's looking for answers. He's Upset.
.He did. He turned the other cheek and they punched it.
You're late. I'll try again later. Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her back to him. She's glued to the set.

Yes.
(on the TV) What could you do? Horns - hat in hand, goes to the door. He wants to stay.
Coffee's by the... door.

There's something about him... I don't know. A female REPORTER concludes the footage...
Just a quick one.
I want to.
""Once there was a way, to get back homeward. Once there was a way, to get back home.""
Shut up.
""Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I will sing a lullaby...""
(checking watch) No... no... no!


Glasses.
You know Hancock?
(to Hancock) Which piece would you like?
Horus is in the securities business.
It's a large department store, over a couple million in merchandise... stereos, jewelry. On three floors.
(in a whisper) Horus, what do I do?
(to Horus) What do I do with him... when you're gone? I have to entertain this super... She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the participants.
Aaron.
(to Hancock) He comes home crying.
(the original sin) Oh, I forgot to make coffee. She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.
No, I'll make it right now.

What're you doing? She's taken by this scene.
About him?
No. They're lying through their collective teeth.
Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better...

Have a good one.
What were you doing in the street? (the trenchcoat) You ripped it pretty good.

It'll be all right.
It's just the seams. I can sew it back.
(the trenchcoat) This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good care of it.
Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for you, all right? Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.
(like a little girl) Let's see.
Come on, I want to see.
I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain. Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his. He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls her hand away.

(into his eyes) It's not your fault.

You should slow down. Rest.
(heat; upon some thought) It must be hard.
To always do right... do good when all you want to do is rest.
Where... who are you?
(sizing up his words) You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do.
It's like, everything you say sounds... so perfect. Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way. I mean, not to say that it's insincere...
So, you never answered. Back there... what were you doing in the middle of the street?
You're still up? She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.
Nick's market. Are you sick?
You want some milk? I'll heat it up for you, how about that?
Yes, he is. He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues dressing - oblivious.
Yes.
What facts? He's not a hero.
Aaron likes him.
No. I have to start on dinner. So how about that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.
All right, already. How's your mouth?
Hold still.
Shut up.
Horus?
Horus? She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into the stairway outside. There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.
(grabs his head) Aaron, hold it. Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes. So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and bones. It SNARLS at Aaron. Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't let go of them. Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in him.
Hancock? The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.
Your hair. Come on, have a seat.
Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n homework.
There... my hero. He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.

I started out just trimming for Horus. Here and there. He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a police captain there... in Philly. When we moved here, I pretty much took over as the resident barber. You know, to save some money.
His father's idea. Not his. He went through it anyway, like he had something to prove... the validation of his manhood.
Want?
The hair... I need to...
Yes?
Why... what for? They're eye to eye. Close.
Yes. Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!
All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...
I'm sorry.
Really? On the boardwalk?
I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.
Good night.
What? Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.
Eat... and we'll go. (checks her watch) Where's your father? She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.
I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave. I'm sorry.

(didn't hear) What?
Is everything all right?
Tell me what's wrong. He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into darkness.

Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there?
Hancock... what...
Me? What can I do? (she's helpless) What do you want me to do?
How? Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her. Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing her senses, pulls away.
Don ' t.
I can't.

I love him. The death blow.
I love him. I'm sorry. One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console... but what can she do?
I'm sorry.
Horus...
What happened toyou?
Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to your room.

Horus, what're you talking about? (re: bruises) Who did this to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.
Why do you say that?
(ballistic) L are. Did You're a fool, that's what you you think I was completely blind when I married you? Something cuts at your masculine ego and it's the pressure... the standard's unreasonable. The woman, she wants me to part oceans. That's the kind of bull shit's made of. I went w through it...,I was there when the hurt came, when the academy said no. I there. And when you felt like hiding... from me and your ownforward. taking Rent job, I stepped It was you, Horus Longfellow. otile. I didn't take the love away. here. the closet, Horus stands there - tears, almost. He takes to his security retrieving his U-Rent Security Jacket. He grabs hat. Straightens his hair. Puts it on.
Horus!
(stroking his hair) ""Once there was a way, to get back homeward...""
""Sleep pretty darling, do no t cry. And I will sing a lullaby...""
Sleep tight. She leaves. Aaron stops her by the door.

(she's white) What're you doing? Hancock closes in. Corners her.
Hancock, please. He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes out of fear for Aaron.
Stay back, Aaron! Hancock takes her away - like booty. Aaron dangles from his cape, trying to save his mother.. In vain. The superhero springs into the night - with his woman.
What're you doing?
Please. But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his hand down her back and between her buttocks.

I'm cold.. Hancock does not respond.


What have you dome?

Horus!
Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him. (grabs him) It'll never go away. Hancock responds to ""it.""

","How's the eye?
It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it up with some make-up and you won't even know it's there.
(almost apologetically) There'll always be people around who'll... exert force over those of us who just want to live in peace. Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.
I'm late for work. Get some sleep. Tomorrow always feels better...
Mary.


Roheim. Let's go home. Roheim stirs...
I just made the last run. He helps the old man to his feet.
Clyde... Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.
Thanks.
How was your day? Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.
(to Mary) Mary? Mary blinks back her attention.
(tapping the door) Let me see your eye... (to Mary) I told him about the other cheek. Avoid confrontations... to turn the other cheek.

Mary?
(opens door) Good thing he was there. I don't know what I'd do... if you... Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She turns to face an empty room.
(clearing throat) Oh, it's not like you... what you do or anything. A department store over on Third.
I'm a security guard. I'm just...
It's a night job. I sit around.
(at his watch) I need to get ready.
Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't want to interfere. I have work.
It's all right, Mary. I'm late.
I don't have time. I'll grab some on the way. Thanks. Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.

It's a short walk. Acknowledged. An awkward beat while they stare at each other... . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight. From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.
A cup of coffee, please. Holly takes the order. Leaves to fetch it.
(turns; with dread) How are you, John?
You know... things are slow.
(without looking) Another dream?'
Roheim.
Come on.
No.
No.
(pulling teeth) You shouldn't drink.
(burning...) Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief moment?

Just get in? Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic attire. She nods affirmatively.
I can't sleep. She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms her own with the left, as reference. Horus tilts his head away from her hand.
Please, Mary.
No thank you.
He'll take him home?
What do we know about this man? The papers... they don't have all the facts about him.
Yes. A hero. I know that...


I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I pick you.
Dear God. Horus catches him.
Jesus. Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to nurse' the wounds.
(dabbing the torn lip) Who... what happened?
Why didn't you come through the back... standing out there in the dark?
What're you doing?

Stop.
You're not old.
No one's canning anyone. No one saw us... watch your step... leave.
You're going to be okay?
Get some sleep.
(washing over it) I have to get home, now. I'll call. Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.
(loosing his voice) I'd like my sports page, please.
I want you to stop taking my sports page.

That there... my sports page.
No.
No. I would like my sports page now. Please.
I'd prefer it now.
Mary! A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the apartment.
Drink. The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.

No... nevermind. (going to blow) Where's your bathroom?
How much.
Thank you.
(on the ground; prone) Son. Go to your room. Struggles to his knees.
Aaron. Go to your room.
Don't ""Horus Longfellow"" me, Mary. I'm not your child. I'm your husband.

Because I let you down.
All that I can do. the frontdoor. And with that, stumbles out of
Police?

Mary. He's off, slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs. Makes his way down to the second floor... where he is greeted by a gun NOZZLE, pressed against his temple.
What're you doing here. ROHEIM ed Mary called earlier. She was worri about you.
Mary...
(on the TV) Mary...
He's got Mary, Roheim. (blank; uncertain) I got to get her.
I got to do what I got to do. Aaron stares up at his father - ""did he just say that?""
Jesus, Aaron. I don't want you to be here.
Fuck you. Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus. Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock. CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the street. Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus - grabbing him by the collar. With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying. THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.


","Black. Horus enters. Stands awkwardly before his son.
Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly make-up on my face. Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.
.after a good night sleep. The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the room.

(in disbelief) I got the only mother does this. in the world that I'm not lisMARY g. Lalalala..,
I know it. I know it.
What?
What? Nothing. It's fine.
What? Not here, mom.
I know it, mom. Can I go now?
(there is no god) Geez! He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.
All right, mom. He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.
(about to break) You were late.
The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.
Get a grip, mom. They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the stairs.
Can't sleep. He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother. They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this man.
Don't.
Mom.
Oh, mom.
What?
Principles?
What am I suppose to do?
I wanted... there were three of them.
(thinking about it) He gets away. Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.
What're you saying?
What?
Why're you telling me all this?
He comes for dinner. Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.
You want milk?
It makes mom fart, too. Mary CHOKES on her food. Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the utensil - and finding difficulty. Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the above. She picks up the fork.
Good arm.
On the right. He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.
mom?
(making a fist) I wanted to kill him.
I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense up... like I can't even move.
Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.

(releases fist) Thinking. Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.
No. Not really. Are you?
Me neither. I was thinking.., about tomorrow.
I know, mom... after a good night sleep. He says that but he's the one working every night. Does that mean he never feels better? He's always feeling terrible?
Mom? She turns.

I got to do what I got to do. She watches him go -curious.

(to the boys) Don't mess with me. He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline taking him away.
.o his mouth was. open and he just stared up at me, it hurt that bad. And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair - a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.
""Don't mess with me."" Mom, remember that guy in the cop movie... he said that?
It doesn't hurt, I told you.
(to Mary; oblivious) He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up again...
God, my friends will freak. Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.
I like it long.
it's almost eight. Dad's late.
like this? (holds up hand) How do you make a fist?
Mom's going butcher your hair.
Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her, Hancock. Hancock shrugs a ""what can I do.""
my mouth. It's starting to swell. I think he loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls.
The toast's burnt.
We're late... you forgot the corn chips. Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all over the place.
You forgot the corn... (the comb snags) . ouch!
You having your period, mom? She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.
Are you all right, mom?
You're acting weird.
I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think it's time for your nap. Aaron leaves. Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.
(a slight smile) Hi.
(the smile fades) I saw you walking. Where were you today? You said you'd... be there. Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.
Where are you going? Can I go?
Those assholes got me in the bathroom, today... (trying to hold on) and you said you'd pick me up at school. Hancock turns. He's upset now.
Dad, are you wasted?
He is wasted. Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa. When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.
But dad...
Thanks, mom.
Mom. Tomorrow always feel bette r.
Probably.
Don't you fucking touch her! Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says...
Don't touch her you bastard!
No! Mom!
(through heavy sobs)
Let me go you bastard.
Dad! He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying.
I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry.
Damn right, dad. We got to get her. Horus at the screen - oblivious. ""What can I do?""
Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the bloodhounds?

","Written by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan
on the dotted line. Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's grab.
I need quiet. Is it quiet?
(mumbling; rehearsing) it's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you... to correct the ills of man. No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to sleep.


(catching the renegade slug) Why'd you go and do that for? Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back, clutching his head. He bleeds.
(steps forward) Why don't we call it the day.


(he's had enough) I'm all out. Let's go... And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.



What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.


You smoke?
Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid. (beat; takes a puff) Smoke no evil. Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.
(re: cigarette) Ever curious... .what it's like? Aaron shakes his head.
(hands it to.him) Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't kill you. Once. Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on it. Doubles over, coughing.
Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your first stick. Then, after a few more... it starts getting this. flavor. A little nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only now, it takes a whole pack to get there.., and you won't settle till your, mouth's as sweet. Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing philosophical.

Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just about all you need to know: a man's got to do what a man's got to do. (beat; smokes) I look at your face, the shiners. You took a shove and you let it go clean. Not good. That's a formula for future abuse... an invitation to the loser's dance. Letting it go. Walking away. ,(shakes head) Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're running, looking for a place to hide.
You do what is necessary.
What is necessary.
To slip away, maybe."" The fox decides to go down fighting, make a stand. Right?
No. The fox gets his ass kicked and some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs, like cheap fabric.
But you know, when the last hound was through with him,-and he's walking away, he hears this noise. It's the fox and he's muttering something under his breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets up close. To hear what he's saying. You know what the fox's saying... just before he keels off? Aaron - negative.

No regrets. You make a decision and you stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And ""no regrets."" Aaron - submitting it to memory.
(a beat to think) Look at it this way... I got to do what I got to do.
I'm sorry.
Man of the house?
Breasts, please. Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.
No. It gives me gas. Thank you. A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.
not about the labor... or the love of it. (beat; we've heard this before) .It's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you. The gift of might. Might to.do what? Exploitation, because you can? Or a different path. To purvey justice. To correct the ills of man... because I can. Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are charmed, his words secondary to his charisma. Horus, the quiet observer, observes.
You're a security guard. You keep the state of things. It's a job. You do it.
Aaron, could you show me the restroom? Aaron points first door in the hall.
(lost; sombre) and you could see the flames, through the storm... I get there, the vessel's all over, spread across three miles of South Pacific. Bodies floating in the water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns out, the only one alive was the captain, up against a buoy... crying 'cause he didn't go down with his men... and he's got to live with it.


No, I need to go. (at' Mary and only Mary) The last time I had a meal... an evening like this, I was... it was too long ago. I appreciate your kindness.
Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll drop by after school. See how you're doing.
Need a lift?
(nothing happened) How are you? In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator. Hancock shrugs a smiles.
didn't see it coming... left myself open.
All right?
What?
You'll sew -it?
You have to be quick.
If you blink, you'll miss it. Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into moisture. It showers into his open hands. Mary reaches for it. Too late.

I'm sorry.
I've been tired, lately.
-So people tell me.
Hard?
It's harder to not do anything. What am I? It's not for me. It's for... it is about people. Rest? When there is despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am relief. You know that instant, that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare... the totality of fear itself... that it's all been a bad dream? That it's safe? That is relief. The infant in my arms... to the hysterical mother. When you can see her face, what's rest? It is self-indulgence. Mary - in some advance stage of ""wow.""
It's not important who I am, Mary. Or what... where I'm from. It doesn't matter. I'm a man. I am every man.
Why... do you say that?
Yes... (pulling teeth) sometimes. Mary allows the moment to sink in.

What?
Nice. Thank you. Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...
He was in the-police academy? A pause.
Is that what you want?
What you need?
Mary?

It's getting late.
I'm going to take a walk.
Maybe. Pause.

(considers; nah) Get lost. The warning comes across quite well - the man exits. Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.
What?
got to do what you got to do. He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other hand. We sense a decision brewing...
I know you're up, Mary. I know you can hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's important that I talk to y ou, then.
Hi.
(constipated; following some
(at the clouds) They're moving. The turbulence has started.
Look out there and what do you see, Mary?
see it,can It's out there. But you can't Y nu? (beat; holding on to a thread) And that's good, not seeing. But for me, I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out there.
Duty. (beat; at Mary) You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you. He'll say: ""you do what you have to do."" Or what? You let the next guy do it for you, if you don't... if you can't. (losing it) And... but. If I can't, then who?
The next guy? No. There is no ""I can't."" Just ""I must."" Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.

I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll break. I need to get away. Get away to where? I don't know. (at Mary) I need your help.
I want you to save me.

You can. (the hard sell)
To whom?
No. (turns from her) Unacceptable.
I'm cold. Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.

(turning; drunk) What're you doing here?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't want to go where I'm going.
Listen. Aaron recoils.
No, not my job. Don't put that on me. (pounds his chest) Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal with it, kid. You are what you are and... what I say, it won't do you any change. You'll grow up to be just like-your old man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can do about it... 'cept grab both ankles, hope by the grace of God the reaming's gentle. Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.
I can't.
I can't.
(in tears) I can't. His arm rips through the glass...
I can't!
(losing it) I need a cigarette, goddamn it! He storms from the bed. Heads for the bathroom.
No... don't. No.
(maniacal; drunk) Amway, anyone? The pursuit commences - Hancock steadies after Mary, in retreat around the living room.
It's the haircut, Mary. (strikes his head) I'm pissed! Out of nowhere - Aaron charges the caped psychotic. He trampolines on Hancock's back, trying to saddle him.
Shut your mouth. He swats the kid off his back.
You're getting on my nerves.
What I got to do.
Please... A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS... STRIKES Hancock across the face.
(a desperate child) Help me.
Make it go away, Mary. Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him struggle.
No... do what I got to do. He unloads a PUNCH. PUNCTURES brick. Clear through...
Go away! Go. Away. The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops. S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins. Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of shells strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of superFLESH. He stares at them all, invincible.
Go away!
I made them go away.
(holding his head) The noise...
Why?!

You ready to rock it up? Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock follows, toying with the man. Horus disappears inside.
Are you a man?! Horus answers... He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the brick structure.

","(dream state) Olga...
. bitch. From the dark recesses of sleep - he wakes. Straightens up. Slurps back his dignity.
You're a good man.
I'll just play out the rest of this Eight Ball... He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries from his jacket.
Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of warm spit... couldn't find their asshole with common sense and a thumb.

Olga... He snaps out of it...

I was talking again, huh?
. that look on her face, you know the look, when she's almost there... makes you feel like a man.

(gets up) Walk with me.

Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you allow me to drink... to poison myself. Your friend. Without a word of caution. Not a word. Just take it... you take everything.
You're afraid to offend. You don't want to be abrasive. Provocative. (beat; as'Horus squirms) So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it. Roheim takes another gulp.
