txt,"Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command.Nothing. He pushes the button again.
Star Command - come in. Do you read me? (to himself) Why don't they answer?!!Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging. Thebox is designed to look like a spaceship.
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair!Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- hiswrist communicator.
Buzz Lightyear Mission Log. Stardate 4072: My ship has run off course en route to sector 12. I've crash landed on a strange planet. The impact must have awoken me from hyper-sleep.Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.
(into communicator) Terrain seems a bit unstable...He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.
(into communicator) No read-out yet if the air is breathable... and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere --
(de-activating his laser beam) Local law enforcement! It's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crash landed here by mistake.Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation.Woody tries to keep up.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Watch yourself!!Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wristlaser.
(continued) Halt! Who goes there?!The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.
(to Woody) Do you know these life forms?
Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up.Buzz walks over to the toys.
I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace.Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.
Why, thank you... (pulls away) Now thank you all for your kind welcome.
I'll show you.Buzz presses a button on his chest.
Well...no, actually I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzzarrived.
Ah, ah, ah, please be careful! You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
Toy?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Excuse me.Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.Again the toys GASP IN AWE.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Yes, I can.
Can!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
All right, then, I will. (to toys) Stand back everyone!The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards theedge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost. He poses like ahigh diver, shuts his eyes...
To infinity and beyond!!...and leaps off the bed.Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball andbounces right back up.He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down thetrack, through the loop, and off a ramp. Buzz soars upwardinto a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels. The impactturns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin aroundand around.All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate fromthe plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody andthen opens his eyes.
Can.The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH
Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
(continued) Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see thesole of his boot.The name ""ANDY"" is written on it in permanent marker.
Well, I must get back to repairing my ship.Buzz walks away.Woody looks at HIS foot -- ""Andy"" is written on it also butin a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.
Unidirectional bonding strip.Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tapedispenser.
What are you talking about? (to Robot) Where's that bonding strip?!Buzz rolls himself back under. Woody rolls him out again.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
The air isn't toxic.Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!Buzz closes his helmet.
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Where?Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.
What's going on?
I'd better take a look anyway.Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
You mean that happy child?
Well, then we've got to do something!Buzz steps up onto the window ledge. The toys GASP IN SHOCK.
I'm going to go teach that boy a lesson.
Be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous.While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lightingthe fuse of the M80.
I could have stopped him.
Trouble?! (looking around) Where?!
Then we've no time to lose!!Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.
I don't see anything!Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.
What kind of a toy -- ?Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him. He dives outof the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
(getting in Woody's face) But we're not on my planet, are we?
Buzz Lightyear Mission Log. The local Sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort --Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic toseething anger. He charges at Buzz.
(into wrist communicator) According to my nava-computer, the --
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet. I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. (pointing at Woody) And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with Star Command.Woody explodes.
You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. Farewell.Buzz walks off.
(continuing to walk away) Go away.Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation andthen eyes...
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Well, then let's climb abroad.Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of thepizza truck. Woody chases after him.
Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit.In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rearview mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.
Sheriff!Woody is gone. Just the toolbox and strewn trash.
(continued) Sheriff?The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody. He peels offthe back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash.
There you are. Now the entrance is heavily guarded. We need a way to get inside.Woody rises from the trash with a ""MEGA-GULP"" cup on his head.
Great idea, Woody! I like your thinking!
(in burger container)
(in container) Quickly, Sheriff! The airlock is closing.
(mouthing with burger box) Sorry.They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throwoff their disguises. They then take a good look at...
What a space port. Good work, Woody.Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, butnone of the kids look familiar to him. Just then he HEARS...
Now we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12 --Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction whenWoody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Where is it? I don't see the --Buzz stops short at the sight of...
(continued) Spaceship.
Greetings! I am Buzz Lightyear! I come in peace!
(continued; to the aliens) Who's in charge here?All the aliens point upward.
(loud whisper) What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I was --
Sheriff! I can see your dwelling from here! You're almost home.
(whispering to Woody) I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.Sid struggles for a moment with his ""patient"" then stops.
They're cannibals!Woody retreats back into the backpack.
May day! May day! Come in, Star Command! Send reinforcements!... (pause) Star Command, do you copy?No response.Buzz adjusts his laser light. It emits a short BLIP.
(aiming his arm out the pack) I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Are you alright? (whacking him on the back) I'm proud of you, Sheriff. A lesser man would have talked under such torture.Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cerealspoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.
(checking his wrist communicator) Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --Woody's eyes light up.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Shield your eyes!Buzz fires his laser at them. The little red beam justflickers against Babyface's head. The mutant toys lookconfusedly at each other.
It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for hours --
Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
Woody, stop it!!
(whisper) Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Shhh!Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then dartsacross the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow.Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area andmeets up with Buzz.As he stands...
Split up!Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway. Buzzdives behind one while Woody jumps into...
Star Command!Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about tospeak into it when he is interrupted.
To Infinity and Beyond!Buzz leaps off the banister...and falls.In SLOW MOTION Buzz watches his square of blue sky pullfarther away from him as he plummets to the floor below.
He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frillyapron and fashionable party hat.
Gone! It's all go-o-one! All of it's gone. Bye-bye! Whoo-hoo! See ya!Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm.
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy... (pointing at other dolls) ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.The headless dolls turn and wave.Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it onthe table.
(grabbing Woody) Don't you get it?! You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! (hysterical laughter)
(sober) I'm sorry. You're right.
(continued) ...I'm just a little depressed, that's all. I can get through this.Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Look at me! I can't even fly out of a window!Woody stops short. He looks down the hallway in thedirection of Sid's room.
(continued) But -- the hat looked good. Tell me the hat looked good! The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached.Woody's anger turns to confusion.
I can't help. I can't help anyone.
Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. (looking at himself) You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yeah, right.
But why would Andy want me?
He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Woody! It's the moving van.
...almost
Woody! Woody?! Are you alright?!Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.
(loud whisper) Woody?! Great! Help me out of this thing!Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz.
What?!
Woody?! What are you doing?!Sid emerges from the tool shed. Buzz freezes.
Woody!Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed toSid's launchpad. Buzz extends his hand to Woody.
Thanks.They shake.
Woody! The van!Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.
Just go! I'll catch up!Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.The van begins pulling out of the driveway.Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of thefence.The two toys run out into the street just in time to see thevan driving off down the street.
Come on!
You can do it, Woody.Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.
Hold on, Woody!
(spinning) Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!Rocky throws Woody to the floor.-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scudgiving close chase.Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.
Who-o-o-oa! Woody!The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving.Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holdingthe remote).
(pointing ahead) Look out!!The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the carthat had passed over Woody earlier.Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote ahard left, missing the tire by inches. The RC Car moves upunder the car.
Look out!!The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams intothe road. Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping thepavement.
The batteries! They're running out!RC's headlight eyes sag. The car slows even more.As Slinky continues stretching. The RC Car begins to weaveside-to-side like a water skier.
Woody! The rocket!
Woody?! What are you doing?
You did it! Next stop. Andy.Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.
Not today!Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest.
This isn't flying. This is falling -- with style!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Quiet everyone, quiet!
(defensively) Me? No, no, no, no... (beat) Are you?
","(to himself) Pull my string! The birthday party's today?!Woody thinks.
(to the room) Okay, everybody. Coast is clear.The bedroom comes alive. TOYS emerge from the toy box, thecloset, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sitshimself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Okay, thank you. At ease.Woody hops off the bed.
Hey, Slinky?
No, Slink --
Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys inthe room are watching. He leans in close to Slinky.
(whispering) Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Be HAPPY!Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.Woody proceeds in the other direction. He passes a toyROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.
(to the room) Staff meeting, everybody. (aside) Snake, Robot -- podium duty.Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantlyfollow Woody.Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the otherdirection.
Hey Etch! Draw!Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketchetches a gun on its screen.
(pretending to be shot) Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've been working on that draw. Fastest knobs in the west.Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.
Now where is that -- ? Aw, hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk andwalks over to it. As he reaches down to pick it up...REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.
(unaffected) Oh, how ya doin', Rex?Rex suddenly turns timid.
I was close to being scared that time.Woody heads back to the podium. Rex follows.
(choking) Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
(blushing) Oh, hey - it was nothing.
(very flustered) Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack ofABC blocks.
(grabbing microphone) Oh, thanks, Mike. (to the crowd) Okay --
(to Mike) Oh, whoa, step back --Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.
Hello? Check? Better? Great. Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf, can you hear me? Great! Okay, first item today...oh, yeah. Has everyone picked a moving buddy?The toys all MOAN.
Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a big joke. We've only got one week left before the move. I don't want any toys left behind. A moving buddy -- if you don't have one, get one! (checking the pad) Alright, next...uh...oh, yes. Tuesday night's ""Plastic Corrosion Awareness"" meeting was, I think, a big success and we want to thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us. Thank you, Mr. Spell.The words ""You're welcome"" scroll across Mr. Spell's displayscreen as he speaks.
Ok, uh...oh yes. One minor note here... (under his breath) Andy's birthday party's been moved to today. (full voice) Next we have --The toys all PANIC.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried.
C'mon, guys! Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about.Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.
(continued) It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for. Right?Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Stay calm, everyone!!Too late. The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towardsthe bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.
Uh, meeting adjourned.The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to geta peek outside.
Alright! Alright!The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.
(continued) If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Okay, save your batteries!
Sargent. Establish a recon post downstairs. Code red. You know what to do.
And this -- (turning on the baby monitor) -- is how we find out what is in those presents.
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best. C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
A lunchbox?!
Last present!
So did I tell ya? Huh? Nothing to worry about.
No, no! Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!Woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both Hamm and PotatoHead aside.
There.
Andy's coming, everybody! Back to your places. Hurry!The toys PANIC and scatter about the room.
(composing himself) Uh-h-h-h...nothing! Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake.
Hey! What did I tell you earlier? No one is getting replaced.The toys give each other a look of doubt.
Now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big ""Andy's Room"" welcome.Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over theedge. His eyes widen at the sight of...
Hello-o-o...
Aaaaaaah! Whoa, hey, whoa, did I frighten you? Didn't mean to. Sorry. Howdy! My name is Woody and this is Andy's room. That's all I wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see, the bed here --While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge onWoody's vest.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes. They're Andy's toys.
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
T-O-Y. Toy.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly!
No, you can't.
You can't!
Can't! Can't! Can't!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
That wasn't flying! That was falling with style!
Oh, shut up! In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Finally!He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discoversthat his hat is missing.
(looking back into the toy box) Hey! Who's got my hat?The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.
(sarcastic) Ah-hah! Ah-hah-hah! (grabs the hat) Give me that!Woody leaps out of the toy box.
(nonchalant) Uh, let what? I don't -- Uh, what do you mean? Who?
Alright! That's it!Woody angrily marches across the room.Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on theABC blocks. Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides underthe ship like a mechanic. Snake and Robot stand by waitingfor instructions. Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
And another thing. Stop with this spaceman thing. It's getting on my nerves.
Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating abutton that makes the spaceman's helmet open.Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR. He drops to his kneesand begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.Woody is unsure how to react.Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.
You actually think you're THE ""Buzz Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! (to the room) Hey, guys! Look! It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, no, no, no... (pointing behind Buzz) Buzz, look! An alien!
Uh-oh.Slinky hides under the bed.
I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny?
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
(redirecting Buzz's view) That's why. Sid.
No! No, that's Scud, you idiot!Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view.
THAT is Sid!
Yeah, sure. You go ahead. Melt him with your scary laser.Woody presses Buzz's laser button. It emits a WIMPYELECTRONIC BEEP. Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.
Buzz, I would love to see you try. (gesturing to Sid's yard) 'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.
(to himself) One toy?He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking awaytowards the opposite end of the desk.Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.
(whispering) Will Andy pick me?He tips the 8 ball over. The triangular oracle floats up tothe surface. Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.
Don't count on it?!! Doh-h-h-h!Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust. It rolls acrossthe desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the deskand peers down it.
Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
(pointing to the back of the desk) Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Oh, he's there. Just, just keep looking.Woody hits the ""FORWARD"" button on the remote and steers theRC Car straight for Buzz.
Buzz!!!Woody looks out the window. No sign of Buzz. All the othertoys rush over to the sill.
Wait a minute. You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Now, it was an accident! Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
No, no, no, no! Wait! Wait I can explain everything --
Oh, great. How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.
Buzz!Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody. He is furious.
Buzz! You're alive! This is great! Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved! Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake. Huh?No response from Buzz. Just an angry stare.
(weakly) Right? Buddy?
Oh. Oh, that's good.
No.Buzz lunges for Woody. The two toys fly off the seat andout the open side door of the van.
Ok! Come on! You want a piece of me?!Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.Woody lunges with all his might. He smacks Buzz in theface, making it SQUEAK with every blow.Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.
Owwwww!!!Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activatingBUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.
Doesn't he realize that I'm not there? (beat) I'm LOST! Oh, I'm a lost toy!Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings. He flips open hiswrist communicator.
You!
(whispering) Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
(incredulous) WHAT?!! What are you talking about?!Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to thestars.
YOU ARE A TOY!!! You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear, you're an action figure!! You are a child's plaything!!!Beat.
Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya looney!Woody walks away in the opposite direction.
(to himself) Rendez-vous with Star Command.
(to himself) Pizza Planet...Andy!Woody takes a step forward and then stops.
Oh, no! I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.Woody runs back under the tanker truck. Buzz is at the farend of the truck, walking away from Woody.
Buzz! Buzz, come back!
No, Buzz, you've gotta come back. I found a spaceship!Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody.
It's a spaceship, Buzz!
Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
(loud whisper) Yeah, but, Buzz! Buzz!
(loud whisper) Buzz!
It'll be safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot!The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propellingWoody to the back of the truck.The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turnsand hills at high speeds. Woody is helplessly thrown aroundthe truck. With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain.The truck climbs a steep hill. Woody looks up just in timeto see...
(using straw as periscope) Ow! Watch where you're going!
(to himself) Andy!
Wait a minute! No Buzz! This way! There's a special ship. I just saw it!
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.The toys manage to get ahead of Andy. Woody peeks aroundthe corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom andAndy to approach.
(tracking Andy and family) C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Alright Buzz, get ready...Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice,his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.
Okay, Buzz, when I say ""go,"" we're gonna jump in the basket --Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone. He looks across theway just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane gamethrough the ""PRIZE"" slot.
(loud whisper) Buzz!Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.It has already gone past.
Dooh! No! This cannot be happening to me!!Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to holdback for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by.
(to himself) This is ludicrous.
Oh, no! Sid!!!Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing thetwo of them deep into the pile of aliens.
Get down!!Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of hispants pocket.
(loud whisper) YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Hey! What are you doing?
Stop it, you -- ! Stop it, you zealots!
(to Alien) Will you be quiet?!! (to both) You guys don't get it, do you? Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out.
(loud whisper)
Not Sid's room...not there...
We are gonna die. (bolting out of the pack) I'm outta here!Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles toopen it. No good. Woody drops to the floor.
Locked! There's gotta be another way out of here.
Uh...Buzz? Was that you?Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed. Woody turns on theflashlight and shines the beam in the direction of thenoise, illuminating...
Hey! Hi, there, little fellah! Come out here. Do you know a way out of here?The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one-eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector setpieces.
B-B-B-Buzz!Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war asthey grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging themoff into the shadows.
Oh, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
The door! It's open! We're free!!Woody runs for the door. Buzz follows.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick!
Oh, you idiot! You're a toy! Use your karate chop action!Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutanttoys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz'sarm involuntarily ""chop"" up and down.
(to mutants) Get away! Hoo-cha! Hoo-cha!
Back! Back, you savages! Back!Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway,continually chopping Buzz's arm.
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door.
(to himself) There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home......turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps,and is confronted by...
(muffled gasp)
(pulling Buzz's hand away) Don't tell me what to do!
Oo-o-of! (to the hallway) Buzz?! The coast is clear. Buzz? Where are you?
(under his breath) Buzz!Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm andpours imaginary tea with it.
Oh, no!
(high voice) Hannah! Oh, Hannah!Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.
Buzz! Hey, Buzz! Are you okay?Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.
What happened to you?
I think you've had enough tea for today. (helping Buzz up) Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Snap out of it, Buzz!Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the facewith his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet.Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody.Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows.
(loud whisper) Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz.
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzztowards Sid's room.
(continued) Come on, this way!
Hi!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?Buzz is not there. Woody looks down at the floor.Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing ""bombs away"" with hisbroken arm.
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
It's a long story, Bo. I'll explain later. Here, catch this!Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over. Slinkycatches them.
Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me!
No, I'm not! (to Buzz) Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
(to Andy's toys) Just a sec.
Buzz! Will you get up here and give me a hand?!Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands byWoody's feet.
(insincerely) Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. (exploding) This is serious!!
(forced casualness) Oh, hi Buzz! Why don't you say ""hello"" to the guys over there?
(shaking the arm's hand) Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake. Gimme five, man!
So, you see? We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz? (as BUZZ) You bet. Gimme a hug.Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.
(continued; as himself) Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Nothing.Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up......exposing the severed arm.The toys all SCREAM in horror. Rex clasps his hands to hismouth and turns away to BARF.Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it'stoo late.
No! No, no, no, no!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here!
Come back! Slink! Slink, please! Please! Listen to me!Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds.
(continued) No! No! Come back! SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!
Go away, you disgusting freaks!Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with hiserector-set pinchers.Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm.Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.
Alright back! Back, you cannibals!Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room,crashing into the wall.By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass ofmutant toys.Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.
He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters!He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his wayto...
Hey?! Hey, they fixed you!Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is realwhen he looks to the mutants.
(continued) But -- but they're cannibals. We saw them eat those other toys.The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid'slast ""operation"": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl. Theirheads have been taped back on the correct bodies.The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.
Uh...sorry. I...I thought that you were gonna... (laughs nervously) ...you know, eat my friend.Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the darkcorners of the room.
Hey! No, no, wait! Hey! What's wrong?
Sid!!!FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom. Woody tries to pick up thestill depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.
Buzz! C'mon, get up! Buzz, you're...
Fine. Let Sid trash you. But don't blame me.Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floorand hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...Sid enters carrying a big box.
Ps-s-s-s-t! Psst! Hey, Buzz!No reaction from Buzz.Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings itat Buzz, striking his helmet.Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.
Hey! Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me.Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.
Oh, come on, Buzz. I...Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help.
Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy.
Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.Woody pauses and looks at himself.
(continued; depressed) As a matter of fact you're too cool. I mean -- I mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure? All I can do is...Woody pulls his own pull-string.
Why would Andy ever want to play with me, when he's got you? (pause) I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz.Buzz lifts up his foot.
Listen Buzz, forget about me. You should get out of here while you can.Silence.Woody turns around.Buzz is gone.Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake. Woody looksup to see...
Buzz!! What are you doing? I thought you were --
Yes Sir!Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, theyfinally get it to move but it's slow progress.
(strained) Come on, Buzz! We can do it!
We've got to get out of here...NOW.Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might. The toolboxbegins to move.Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the toolchest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of thedesk.
C'mon, Buzz.Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.Woody drops down to the floor below.
(loud whisper) Alright. Buzz! Hey! I'm out!Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox(and milkcrate) farther out.
(nervous laugh)The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, whostirs...
(punch-drunk) No, I'm fine...I'm okay...
Aaah! Back! Back! Down! Down!Woody slams the door shut just in time. Scud BARKS ANDSCRATCHES at the door.
(out of breath; to himself) Okay, what do I do? Come on Woody, think!Woody looks across the room.
Guys!The mutant toys all scatter and hide.
No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Listen! Please! There's a good toy down there and he's -- he's going to be blown to bits in a few minutes all because of me. I've gotta save him! (pause) -- But I need your help.No response.Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of theshadows from under the bed.
Please. He's my friend. He's the only one I've got.Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid'smetal bedpost.The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather aroundWoody. He kneels down into a huddle with them.
(to Babyface) Thank you. (to the others) Okay. I think I know what to do. We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works, it'll help everybody.
All right, listen up. I need Pump Boy here -- Ducky here. Legs?LEGS, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, stepsforward from the crowd.
(continued; to Legs) You're with Ducky. (to the others) RollerBob and I don't move till we get the signal. Clear?The mutants all give an affirmative nod.
Okay, let's move!The toys all break.Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby dolltorso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate andpull the face plate off the wall. They disappear into theheating duct.
Wind the frog!WALKING CAR, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins windingup THE FROG, a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheelsinstead of legs.
Wait for the signal.
Go!!Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose.The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway.Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.
Alright, let's go.Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard andcrew out into the hallway.
Lean back!The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do awheelie. They smash through the doggie door...
(to toys in the bush) Let's go!The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.
Shhhhhhh!
(loud whisper) It's ok. Everything's under control.Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.
(regular voice) So play nice.Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house.
Nice work, fellahs. Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch! That was a stroke of genius.
(to mutant toys) We gotta run! Thanks, guys.With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprinttowards the fence.
Quick!Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, butBuzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.
Whew, I made it!Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.Woody looks behind him to see...
(kicking Scud with other foot) Aaaaaahh!! Get away, you stupid dog! Down! Down!Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.
I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!
Buzz!The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz andScud behind.Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto thebumper. He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries tolift up the heavy door.Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop ata traffic light.Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward takingWoody with it.Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truckuntil he spots what he's looking for.
Ah-hah! There you are!!Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.
Ah-h!! Ah-h! No, no!Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoidthe angry mob of toys.Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards themoving truck.Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down onBuzz --Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.
No, no, no! Wait! (as Rocky spins him) Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!-- The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and startsdoing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.
No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there! We've gotta help him!!
No, no, no, wait!The toys toss him out into the road. As the truck drivesoff, the toys CHEER.
Well, thanks for the ride.
Now let's catch up to that truck!
We're almost there.
(to Buzz) Speed up!
Slink! Hang on!Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back intothe moving truck and knocking over all the toys.The RC Car sputters to a stop.Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and movingtruck disappear.Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.
(sarcastic) Great!
The match!Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had putthere earlier.
(continued) Yes! Thank you, Sid!Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match againstRC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when...
No-o-o! No-no-no-no! No-o-o!Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causinghis helmet to block the sun from Woody.As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering andlooks at his hand.
Hold still, Buzz!The fuse lights.
Ha-ha!!
Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket. Rockets explo --
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
(covering his eyes) Ah-h-h-h-h!!Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upwardagain. Woody takes a peek.They're flying.
Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!!
Ha ha!! To Infinity and Beyond!!They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then passover it.
Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck!
Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! (rubbing his neck) There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Buzz. Buzz Lightyear. You are not worried, are you?
(laughing) Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT. as we HEAR...
","Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it. I think I'm just coming off as annoying.A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BOPEEP, the porcelain figurine.
Well I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.
What?! Whadda ya mean, the party's today?! His birthday's not 'til next week!!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
(panicked) Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
They're getting bigger.
We're doomed!Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead insurrender.
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making themonitor drop to the floor. The impact causes the batteriesto roll out.
Oh, no!
Outta my way! Here I come, here I come --Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over.Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPSgrow louder.Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children'sfeet rush in.
Woody? Who's up there with you?Woody crawls out from under the bed. The toys are shockedto discover him there.
Don't shoot! It's okay! Friends!
Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!
Say! What's that button do?
And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not actually from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...Woody walks over to Bo Peep.
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do?
Whoa! Oh, wow! You flew magnificently!
With permanent ink, too!
I thought he was at summer camp!
Oh, no! Not Sid!
Oh, no. I can't bear to watch one of these again!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Hey everyone! RC's trying to say something!The toys turn from the window to RC.
(leaning down close to RC) What is it, boy?
(backing away) Oh, I don't like confrontations.The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.
(holding up an empty barrel) There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel.Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.
(yelling out window) Buzz! The monkeys aren't working! We're formulating another plan! Stay calm! (beat) Oh, where could he be?
Hey, you guys! I think I've found him. Buzz! Is that you?!Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes. Theannoyed MEOW of a cat is heard.
Whiskers! Will you get out of here?! You're interfering with the search and rescue.
(whispering) Look! They're home!The toys duck behind the sill.The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway. Andy and Mrs.Davis get out.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visiblycrestfallen.
You're kidding?
Hey, look!
(overly excited) He got it, Woody!
Hey look! It's Buzz!
(relieved) Aa-a-a-a-ah!
I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
(following Potato Head) Everyone else was picked.
Are we there already?
He's at it again!
Great. Now I have guilt.
Take cover!!Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car.They separate, sending the two toys upward and RC into theback of the truck.RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying.
Oh! It's time!The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards toreveal...
(to Slinky) Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur, like a leaf-eater. That way, I could play the, uh, dominant predator. Ha ha ha!Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.
","(pulling Woody's string) You saved the day again, Woody.
C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)car, and herds the remaining ""cow"" boxes under Molly's crib.
(raising his arms) Score!
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah!
Okay.Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.
It's party time, Woody!
Howdy, Little Lady!He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one lasttime.
(picking up Molly) C'mon, Molly. Oh, you're getting heavy! (to Woody) See ya later, Woody.Andy exits.
Let's go to my room, guys!The kids rush past the houseplant.
Take that, Zurg!Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, downthe gap between the bed and the back wall.
-- and you press his back and he does a karate-chop action!
Oh, yeah!The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THEDOOR behind them.
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroomtransform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on thewall, the pillow, the bedspread.E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR. The space rangersuggests a few tips for the dinosaur. Rex tries again, thistime giving a ""JURASSIC PARK"" ROAR.The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait ofBuzz.Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll'shair, chatting away like a hair dresser.Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoysas weights. Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,using his feet as a treadmill.Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but endsup tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to thebarbell.H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only thecheckerboard.Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky andRobot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's ""ship"" up ontop of ABC blocks for repair.In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending thepieces flying. One of the checkers ricochets off thedresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end isstretched over to the other side where Woody sits. Slinky'swagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving hisfront end no choice but to eventually follow.J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox untiljust Woody and Buzz are left. He deliberates as to whichtoy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.
To infinity and beyond!
Pizza Planet?! Oh, cool!Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing righton top of Woody.
Mom! Do you know where Buzz is?
But Mom, I can't find him!
Okay...He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.
I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there.
Can I help pump the gas?
standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.
Oh, it's so cool...The family begins to walk away.
Mom, have you seen Woody?
(searching the van) Right here in the van.
He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone.The toys all look at one another.
(groggy) But what if we leave them behind?
Hey! Wow!
(picking up the toys) Woody! Buzz!
Here! In the car!
Which one can I open first?
","Ages three and up. It's on my box. Ages three and up! I'm not supposed to be babysitting Princess Drool.HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coinslot. Potato Head walks up to him. All his facial piecesare in the wrong slots.
Hey, Hamm! Look! I'm Picasso!
You uncultured swine! (to someone O.S.) What are you looking at, ya hockey puck?!Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing onthe night stand.
(waving his arm out its socket) Do we have to hold hands?The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
I can't see a thing!Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes outof his head and holds them up over the other toys.
(chanting) Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato Head... (off Rex's look) Hey, I can dream, can't I?
A lunchbox...?!
Who invited THAT kid?!
Hey, watch it!
Oh, ya big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
What is it?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
Oh, really? I'm from Playskool.
Hey, a laser! How come you don't have a laser, Woody?
Laser-envy.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Man, the dolls must really go for you! (aside) Can you teach me that?Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming.Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody.
(walking past) Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
That ain't no happy child.
He's sayin' that this was no accident.
I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed... (pointing at Woody) ...by Woody.
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could ya Woody? Didn't want to face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy, so you got rid of him. Well, what if Andy starts playin' with me more, Woody, huh? You gonna knock me outta the window, too?Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of thedesk -- trapped.
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Huh?! Huh?! I told you he was guilty.
Ohhh! You sunk it!
Are you peeking?
(pulling out his nose; nasally) How 'bout three out of five?He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when...
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Wait! Wait! I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky.
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?! Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz? And now you want to let him back over here?
You are a liar!
Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?!
Murderer!
You murdering dog!
Save it for the jury. I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!Potato Head drops the lights.
(to the other toys) Come on. Let's get out of here.
Will you quit moving around?!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?Potato Head drops back down into the box.
Hey! What's he doing?Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Carout onto the street. The other toys SCREAM in horror.
(pointing at Woody) Get him!!!All the toys pour out of their boxes and CHARGE on Woody.
Toss 'im overboard!
So long Woody!
That a boy, Slink!!All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pullingSlinky's front end off the ramp.
Gee, I better shave.Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz. Lipstick nowcovers Woody's face.
