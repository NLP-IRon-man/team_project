txt,"Long way to come by bus. I thought you guys would have a plane.
A little. Cooper steps to the engine compartment. The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH, 10, watching them. He wanders over.
(shakes his head) Satellite. Big one. Probably Chinese. Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in the upper atmosphere. After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but everyone has seen it plenty of times before. Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.
You ruin it for the boys when you talk like that.
They didn't have any baseball at all when I was a kid. That shuts the old man up for now. They drive on in silence.
I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
Something wrong with your truck?
What does that have to do with anything?
Get the spare, Tom.
All right. We'll use the patch kit. He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks very glum.
Murph's law.
Find something to patch it with.
Figure it out. I'm not always going to be here to help you. Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is looking out over the river.
Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will happen. All kinds of things. Good or bad. And that's the way you want it to be.
Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything. Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
Murph? Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground. Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension, then soars off over the fields behind them. Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph.
Get in. Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling with the jack.
It's a Chinese military drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.
Keep it pointed right at it, OK? Murph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop, trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen fills with Cyrillic characters.
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it. Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted over with corn. They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it. BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of the combine.
Almost got it. Don't slow down. In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone plummets from view.
You want to give it a whirl? Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and moves his fingers gingerly across the pad. In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in the valley below. For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone dancing through the valley below.
Set her down in the valley -- there, next to the river. Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below.
Chinese mission control went down same as us, twenty years ago. It's been up there ever since.
It was looking for something. Intercepted some kind of signal.
Reprogram it. Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor.
We need all the help we can get, Murph. This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us. Cooper gently pries the control module out.
What about college?
You're ruling out college for him now? He's only fifteen.
What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
You're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son's future? Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.
Engineer.
Are we done?
One of my old textbooks. Murph liked the pictures.
Corrected?
You don't believe we went to the moon?
""Useless machines""?
One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger. Most of it, anyway.
You ever consider the best thing for the world and humanity might have been for us to part company? Cooper gets up to leave.
Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes.
Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission to enter your airspace.
Not exactly.
Space probe. Never seen one like it, though. Looks like it's been to hell and back. The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.
Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago. Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open.
Good boy. Hand me the scanner. Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the probe and turns on the power. Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on the controls and it PULSES.
Here we go. Standard NASA encryption. Memory's been damaged. Just noise. Hold on. I've got something. Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen: An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.
I don't know. Cooper looks at the probe.
Where the hell did you come from? Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.
We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow and have it melted down. Might be some copper inside.
There's no one for it to report to. NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son. It got home too late. Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot unceremoniously onto the table.
Maybe it's better for everyone to forget what they did back then. Reminds us how far we've fallen.
It doesn't bother me that he can't go. It bothers me that he doesn't care.
It's a fail-safe. It's going to annoy us into taking it home. Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins SHRIEKING again.
We're going to get some sleep. He begins tying the rope around the probe.
You're staying here and cleaning the house. Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard. Cooper follows his stare.
I told you, Murph. There's no one to take it back to.
Got any diesel?
I don't know. Don't touch them.
Murph? He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses and heads into the forest to look for him.
Careful. There's some kind of underground facility here. We might... Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something: Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them for thirty years. I've never seen one intact before. Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like it might have been standing here for decades.
I think we need to go, Murph.
No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving. Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot. Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy and hoisting him up to eye level. Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot. The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony. Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
We were just looking for salvage.
I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
You've got me wrong, lady.
(points at Tars) Word of advice -- careful with that thing. When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting.
Wait a second-- Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.
Now who's stealing from who?
You're right. It belongs to NASA, which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money. Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand motions for Cooper to step forward.
Who are you people?
Galveston.
Canaveral's been gone for thirty years. Brand ignores him. Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.
Nothing. I got something off of it. Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered defibrillator.
Most of the disk was noise. Couple of clean sectors, though. Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it. Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed. The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier pops onto the screen. The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the images.
There aren't any planets like that anywhere near earth. Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years. Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. She turns to the older engineer.
You can't keep us here.
I'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have. Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by a robot on a nearby bench.
Are you using that for guidance?
The power supply is no good. If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail.
Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida. Had to rebuild every last one.
You plan on keeping us here forever?
I guess no one told them they were out of a job. (nods at Tars) Same as the rest of these people. Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand and the older engineer are arguing about something. She finally relents and walks towards the door. Brand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow.
I thought the old man was in charge.
Not you?
That rocket doesn't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter.
Why are you telling me this? I already told you I'm not going to tell anyone about this place.
But I don't have any of the experience. Any training. You people have been preparing for this for years. Case shakes his head.
No. I'm sorry. Cooper is deeply conflicted. But he can't leave his boys behind.
I can't help you. I have responsibilities. Things that, no offense, are more important than a scientific mission. Case shakes his head.
Rescue? Rescue who?
The blight.
But it doesn't affect the corn.
You've known this for how long? And you didn't try to tell anyone?
But you'd still only be able to save a few hundred. Maybe a thousand.
I can't go. I have to look after the boys.
I have a responsibility to them--
You have to stay here, pal.
There's going to be important work to do here, too. Tears are streaming down the boy's face. Cooper takes his watch off. Looks at it.
I need you to hold onto this. Will you do that for me? Cooper hands Murph the watch. The boy nods, saddened.
I will come back. I promise.
Don't look so happy to see me.
Great idea. A massive, sarcastic robot.
That sounds like a good idea.
I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies.
So you're a salvage diver now? I thought you were a biologist.
We're taking ants with us?
I thought humans were more solitary.
Looks like hard work.
Is that a star? ROTH, 50s, the crew's brilliant and blunt physicist, zooms the map in, revealing, at the center, a black heart.
Lose time? Roth shifts the hologram -- the stars and black holes flatten onto a sheet that bends, revealing the curvature of gravity.
How much time?
Sure. Till we ran out of food and ate all of them.
(to Tars, sarcastic) I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars. Tars hands him a plastic waterproof case.
We'll be back. It sounds like he's trying to reassure himself as much her.
Oh, no. I want to see this. Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the frame and Cooper slides the chip inside. The frame begins its ""handshake"" -- lights illuminate on the body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open.
Bit of a demotion. Tars turns back toward Cooper. He puffs out his chest and suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope, unfolding into long, svelte limbs. When he's done he stands eight feet tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame.
The ship is tiny. Doyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise.
I know. So why are you painting it? Tars looks almost bashful.
Sure it does.
What'd you paint?
How much do these things weigh?
Damn. He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull. Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall. Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time with an exaggerated grin.
Why?
Fine. The anesthetic is working.
Why?
If we're such a liability, why take us along? You and Tars could build the colony without us. You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen.
Humans aren't programmed. Case stops, looking Cooper in the eye.
Did they program you to be condescending?
How would that make us better at surviving?
No. I want to know.
We've almost reached the wormhole.
I know. Thank you.
You never had any? I thought I was a pariah for only having two.
Strange place to look for a new home.
You really think there's a plan?
I guess I just think we're on our own. Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black holes orbiting each other.
Where are we?
Something's happening to the hull over here.
Well, I don't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here. Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.
Can you ask it to stop? Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish. For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the encounter. An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart.
It's working. Tars finishes reeling the nuclear engines back in from their tether and locks them into place. Roth's updated model appears on the monitors. Brand stares at it, startled.
We've lost contact with the relay. Case joins Cooper at the comms screen. While they're distracted, Doyle maneuvers himself over to the engine control.
One long garbled transmission came in. Then nothing. Case looks at the screen. Suddenly, the ship is JOLTED as the engines fire at full power. The crew looks over. Doyle is standing by the controls.
What is he doing?
What about Tars? As the crew watches, Tars continues to hold the engine even as the casing around it begins to melt. Finally, it EXPLODES.
I still can't contact the relay. Brand ignores him at first. She nods at Case.
Did you hear me? We're not able to communicate back home. She waves him off. But she looks shaken by something.
How could they all have landed in the same place?
We're bringing him along?
This is the Taichung mission.
They never landed. Not on Mars. Four human crew, fifteen robots. The log says the base has been here for thirty years. Case's familiar voice comes through the radio.
The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow.
Then what?
What about returning to the ship?
What is this?
Case, wait-- Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice floor disintegrates beneath them. They fall into the darkness.
Breathe. Trust me. She refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath.
Your suit is filling with water. I'm not going to be able to hold it much longer. I'm going to let go. Brand's eyes widen.
Take a deep breath. Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her.
I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism. She gives up and lets him help her out of the water. They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath.
Don't mention it. Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent, like glass, and polished to an impossible shine. He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in their suits, out of the water.
Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice. We're down to three suits. We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth.
Any sign of Brand?
What happens then?
Any sign of big life-forms?
I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls. Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling.
You don't know that. You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden. Brand stops. He's struck a nerve.
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
You know how plants don't usually move? Is that a universal rule?
Hello there. The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head splits open and it BELLOWS.
OK. Now we run. Brand doesn't argue. They turn and sprint through the trees.
We have to reach the shelter. They head off, crashing through the melee.
This way. Brand begins to follow.
I've got you. Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again...
By ""cooperate"" do you mean let it eat me?
Then why are they killing each other?
(trying to be calm) What is it doing?
I don't want it to incorporate me.
They're killing each other.
I'd say they have a long way to go.
But what are they competing for?
Why not?
What difference would that make?
(shakes his head) The plan.
I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help us. People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come.
(looks at her) I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us. We were on our own. Cooper looks away. The memories are never that far away.
Honestly? After the things I saw... you want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us? Because I'm not sure we're worth saving. They sit in silence for a while.
Looks like they lost. They continue through the ruins.
But why didn't they come?
Testing what? Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of different material. The outermost layer is flattened steel.
Everything in here is bolted down. (looks at sphere) What do you think this thing does?
I wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth. Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious.
Old military-grade encryption. It's not very robust. (looks at Case) No offense. Hang on. Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and SMASHES one of the chips on the board. The terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.
That should open up most of it. Case is silent for a beat, parsing the information.
No one was listening.
How long does this place have?
Case, what is that?
No. It's closer than that.
Quick -- hold onto something. He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're no longer floating, they're falling. They're falling up.
They found a way to make gravity.
What does that mean?
But how did the Chinese develop the technology? This would take decades, maybe hundreds of years, to create.
I know this isn't exactly what you trained for. But I think Roth might be right.
Don't make any sudden movements. They can't hurt us if we're unarmed.
Further orders aren't coming. Your government is gone. It ran out of money, same as ours. You're on your own.
Come on. Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins hiking up the mountain.
We're too late. Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware.
The main thruster fuel supply. We're not going anywhere. Cooper looks down. They're stuck here.
But we need to take the box back to earth.
I'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled, but it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back. Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data.
Let me take it.
We're going to find out soon enough. Brand is looking off into the distance.
Where's Brand? She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks out onto the ice. Brand is heading back out into the snow.
Dammit. If I don't make it back, just keep going. (points to probe) Get that thing home. Cooper steps to the door.
Guess you were right -- too much gravity, or not enough. He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They stare into each other's eyes. Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice planet. Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm. Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.
Roth.
How is that working?
Good. We've already set the course, skipper. We're going home. Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level.
Now I know why we weren't able to hit the relay. It's not interference -- the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be. Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.
Nothing.
How much?
Forty seven years. Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned.
We could bypass the relay. Send a conventional shortwave signal.
You knew, didn't you? You and Case figured it out when we landed. Brand looks down.
Sure you could. You're brilliant. You know everything.
They're not children any more... if they're even still alive. He turns away from her.
Yes she did. Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness.
That's why you were upset -- your father. She looks down, filled with sadness.
We can't let that happen. We'll lose more time... too much... The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black hole below them. On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit. As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks -- time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the deep gravity well around the hole. As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the system above them. They watch as the ice planet whirls around them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times.
We're losing years. Finally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction. As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event horizon, just as they saw in the projections. Nothing has prepared them for the reality: The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence. Brand looks at the sample of fractal life. Now they are united -- they are, in all likelihood, the sole survivors of their planet. Doyle points to the instruments.
What will happen to it?
All of those people back home... none of them will make it. As Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral towards the black hole.
Case said the Chinese found something else. The location was scrubbed from their records. But I bet he knows it. Cooper fires up the chip. Begins sorting through the onboard memory. Doyle watches the instruments.
Here. Can we reach it? Brand looks at the map. The point appears on the far side of Gargantua. Brand studies the trajectory.
(points to screen) That? What is it? Brand looks. In one tiny region on the back side of the black hole, the debris simply seems to vanish.
Where are we?
Not a single drink on the whole ship. What kind of mission is this?
You really think we're the last humans alive anywhere?
So that's it, then? That's all? He looks down, saddened by his own words.
What about the plan? The grand scheme.
I didn't. But you were bringing me round. He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves.
What the hell was the point? What did it add up to?
This? You're saying the end result of ten billion years is the atoms from dead stars standing here disagreeing with each other. She smiles at him. Bittersweet.
This thing is made of... gravity?
Can we communicate with them?
What is that? Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its universe.
There's something out there. The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:
This is what the Chinese were protecting.
Must have taken you a while.
How are they keeping the lights on in this thing? Tars, in answer, points to a far door.
It's a map?
So why didn't they return? Why didn't they save us? Brand is staring at the massive map.
They weren't interested in the other wormholes because their mission was to return home. That one leads back to Earth. The Earth they were told to return to. Tars walks to the controls for the device.
Did they make it?
We're going to find out. Cooper walks out of the room. Brand follows him.
You don't know that.
I made a promise. He turns away from her, resolute.
You could have taken one of the other ships.
Where are you going to go?
You're going, too?
I'm sorry. I have to find out what happened to my sons. I promised them. Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. Knows there's no way to change his mind.
I promise. They kiss passionately. Not wanting it to end but knowing that it must. Reluctantly, they separate. Brand turns back to the ship. She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts off and disappears into the darkness. Cooper turns away.
The probe... Doyle looks back.
It's going to work.
That's not what I mean. This is the probe I found in Galveston. Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity well, creating a time machine. The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation.
Brand said there'd be some evidence we'd made it. And there was. This. (holds up probe) But only this. Everything will be destroyed except for this. He moves toward Doyle. Doyle stands.
We have to stop.
You don't need to do this. We won't make it back, but this does. The secrets are already right on it. Maybe someone found it. There's hope.
(over radio, garbled) This is the crew of the Endurance... Murph... I'm sorry... The signal crackles out.
Where am I?
What's coincidence? What is this place?
Where... where are we?
Shoot.
It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed. The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
Because that was the plan.
Feel like I should be pulling my weight.
I was hoping to enroll in a course. Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems.
No one's heard anything from Brand?
Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? I just need a small ship. I made a promise. The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land?
Curiosity. New level setting. 100 percent.
Sense of humor. New level setting. 100 percent. Wait.
Where do you want to go first? The robot thinks it over.
","Is that what they call stealing these days?
It doesn't.
Really? You're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower? Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark.
Get back in your little plane, go back to your farming commune. And don't come back. Cooper backs up. Tars holds up his mangled rifle. Smiles.
I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. Keep moving. Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him. Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL. Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane. He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.
Get it inside.
(points rifle at Cooper) You too. We'll figure out what to do with you later. Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a huge, reinforced service elevator.
This doesn't belong to you.
I found them outside with it. It looks like six. Maybe seven. I can't tell from the radiation damage. The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished.
What did you do to it?
He's heard enough. If we're going to launch, we need to keep them here until afterwards.
He could endanger the mission.
Now how could you possibly know that?
The mission commander wants to see you. Your son can stay here. He'll be all right with Tars. Cooper eyes Tars warily. Then steps outside.
I'm a biologist.
In the last century strands were limited to one or two species. But this one targets everything. Essentially it's more efficient at consuming our food than we are. Cooper looks at the dying corn.
Not yet. But it will. We've grown a dozen forms of it that can. It's just a matter of time before the same ones develop out there.
(shakes her head) Who's going to find it? The universities are a joke. People like you are reduced to scavenging just to get by.
What would be the point? So humanity could spend the last fifty years of its life fighting over the scraps? It's better that they don't know. Cooper begins to argue, then stops. He knows enough history to know she's right. He looks at the withering crops.
A new home for humanity. We'll set up a colony, then return to bring more people across.
Would it be better if we all died? She looks him directly in the eye.
Look -- I don't have a clue what Case thinks you could add to the mission. You can come with us or you can stay here and wait to die. I don't care.
You don't like this one, you get to help me find a replacement. She heads for the door.
We knew we'd need decades of parts and materials. The government was getting rid of some things. So we arranged to take some off their hands. She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. She tosses a compact rebreather.
You know how to use one? (off his look) You just breathe. Tap my arm or bang something metal if you have a problem. And don't get lost. She picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it.
You can set that down over there. Cooper sets the board down. His eye is drawn to a bizarre experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning centrifuge. Brand notices.
We didn't know what kind of gravity to expect. We experimented with collective organisms in high g environments.
Humans are also collective organisms.
It's a paradox. Life couldn't form without gravity. No stars. No planets. The component pieces would just drift apart. But too much of it and you're trapped. Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work. The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the stack of equipment.
As long as we're careful, we'll make it.
I find it hard to believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen just to lead us to a dead end.
A guess. That's right. We don't have time to wait for conclusive proof.
My guess is that the wormhole is there because someone is trying to help us. The same way we used to try to help animals when they were threatened with extinction.
I won't. Cooper looks at her, confused. As he does, the entire rocket SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire.
If we find a habitable environment, I'm staying behind to build the colony. Brand wipes her tears away and settles into the same fearless mask she usually wears. She steals one last look out the window at Earth, then looks back. Cooper begins to say something, but stops as the entire rocket LURCHES as the primary engines FIRE.
Smile. Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness.
Because it lowers your blood pressure.
We'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole. Cooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness.
I can't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind.
Hard to settle down when you've spent your life waiting to leave the planet. Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole system. The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting the smaller black hole.
You wouldn't want to get too close to the surface of the sun, either. Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways.
I hope so. (looks at him) You don't?
This isn't turbulence. Look at the way they're moving -- it's like something's examining us. Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the length of it.
We're moving.
Saving us. Tars tears open the engine's control panel and begins overriding it.
Tars. His transponder is still working. The ship's instruments TONE every few seconds as it communicates with Tars' onboard computer.
I've already checked it. It's electromagnetic interference. We'll try again in a few hours. Cooper begins to ask her what's wrong, but she moves off. Roth looks up from his monitor, excited.
We need all the help we can get. Besides, the alternative is to leave him on the ship alone. You think he'll still be here when we get back? Cooper steps aside, allowing Doyle onboard.
How could the Chinese have gotten here first? The federal government kept the wormhole a secret. Case shrugs. He has a soldier's gallows humor about his old employer's ability to keep anything a secret.
Then how did the probe that Cooper found return?
The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation. What happened here? Cooper looks at the pieces of a modular, one-person rocket, a last-ditch means of escape, stored, untouched in the shelter. He steps back, realizing something.
The Mars mission? The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing. Cooper looks over the relay log.
I'm going to descend to take some samples. Cooper, want to make yourself useful? Cooper begins to say something, then bites his tongue.
How long do we have left?
Then we die. The radiation will cook us alive. Cooper looks around, their predicament settling in. Case walks over to the edge of the mine shaft.
Not enough time. Case is right. The ice can shield us from some of the x-rays.
A pocket formed by gas. There may be more below. The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness. Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick.
Shut up. How much time do we have, Roth? Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment.
I've found something. Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand, which is badly smashed.
These things... they're alive. Roth joins her, looking down at the tiny creatures trapped in the ice. Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again, but nothing happens. Roth takes the depth meter dangling by a lanyard from Brand's suit.
X-rays. They feed on them and emit visible light. They've found a way to survive here. Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms trapped in the ice, mesmerized. Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the ice below. Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. He's found the gas pocket beneath them. Too late. Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically.
(looks at rad meter) They're absorbing most of the x-rays.
What do you mean, you're going to let go?
I don't need your help.
Thank you.
Oxygen atmosphere. Pure water. Temperate climate.
I won't need one.
Because I'm not going anywhere. This is our new home. Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and hikes into the jungle.
This is incredible. The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb x- rays and emit light. In return, these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen, which feeds the animals trapped in the ice. Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks she collected in the ice above, fascinated.
Look at this. I think they're the same organism at a different stage of the life cycle. (shows him the sample) It's fractal. No individual cells -- the structure repeats all the way down. Cooper looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle around them, nervous.
The soil's been disturbed. So something's been moving. But I haven't seen anything. (notices his look) Cooper... are you nervous? Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed.
(truly pissed off) Faith has nothing to do with it. You know what you are, Cooper? You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no.' That this isn't going to work. And frankly, I don't have to convince you.
You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. You want the truth? I told Case we should bring another robot over you. At least then I could just reprogram you to- She stops. Something has caught her attention.
Nothing. I just -- I could have sworn it just moved. She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a hand on it. Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to descend, more rapidly than on Earth. Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze over Brand's fingers. Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her, this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking at the jungle around them, spooked.
No. There really aren't any rules. All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.
(trying to stay calm) Remember, we're the aliens. Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him.
Hold very still. Don't make any sudden movements. Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and staggering toward him.
No... wait. Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing creatures, steps through, and falls...
I've got you. Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them. Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool.
It's game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first.
These organisms have no interest in us. They survive by photosynthesis. All they need is light.
I don't know.
It's a colony organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure.
Don't open your mouth.
No. They don't bleed... they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking for the best one.
The behavior changes as the animals get bigger and bigger. More sophisticated. More calculated. Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other, lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display.
I don't know. Brand shivers -- it's getting colder.
These creatures are billions of years older than we are. But they're relatively primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language.
I don't know. No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes.
Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life.
Exactly. Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan.
Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us? Cooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens.
They're not going to move now, Cooper. They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light.
Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a- She stops. Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff. Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base.
They will. We can salvage it. This place will save us years.
What happened here? Roth stares at the ball, intrigued.
Where did they go?
But I don't understand... why are we here? What are we here for? Cooper looks down. Brand's upset is turning to anger.
What the hell are we here for? I trained my whole life to reach this place. She looks at Cooper, questioning.
Maybe we could work with it. Try to improve it.
And go where?
That doesn't help this planet. This creature is doomed. Unlike us it doesn't have anywhere to go. The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down.
Who? Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together from dried dead pieces of the local foliage. Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias. Case steps protectively in front of his team. The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled.
This planet is being pulled into the black hole. We all need to leave.
This device that you have built -- this could save millions of people. We need to get it back home. Brand points to the device Roth is holding. The Chinese robots seem particularly unhappy with this development.
We can't leave them all to die. She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice.
Was that the last of them?
It doesn't matter how many of us make it. We have to get this back to earth. Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead.
This isn't right, Roth. We can find a way for all of us to leave.
Someone's coming. Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle. Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case. Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he collapses in the snow. He's badly injured -- one leg torn off at the knee, one arm mangled. Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship.
Between you and utter solitude, Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure. They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.
He's gone. Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance.
We're safe now. Cooper heads to the communications equipment.
A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if
Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole. Besides, no one will be listening anymore. The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing. Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.
I thought... I couldn't be sure.
Cooper... we needed to keep going. I'm so sorry. Your children...
Listen, the important thing is that we're going home, now. And we have something that can save everyone. It's more important than the people we left behind- Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger.
He's gone. But there are other people who still need our help. There's still time... The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn: Case is standing at the controls.
Case... what are you doing? Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls. Presses the ""execute"" button. The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship.
Wait... no...
No... We're being pulled back to Pantagruel. Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining boosters.
It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's.
It'll be destroyed, like everything else. Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications screen. Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. Brand opens her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops.
What are you doing?
We can use the thrusters to keep us on the critical orbit. Then slingshot us towards Gargantua. The thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the critical orbit.
It's another wormhole. Doyle FIRES the thrusters again, pushing the ship towards the wormhole.
I don't know. It's like we entered the wormhole and never left it. Brand checks the instruments. There is nothing for the ship to model. There is nowhere to go. They drift.
I'm sorry. I should have told you. I didn't have the right.
Our last trip past the black hole cost us another 100, maybe 200 years. Which means there's a good chance we're the only humans alive anywhere.
I think the last human beings should have a little more fight in them than that. Brand picks up the sample of fractal life and places it under a lamp on the counter. It freezes, absorbing the rays. Doyle looks at the gun.
I think Doyle's been experimenting with the coolant from his spacesuit. They sit in silence for a moment.
I don't know. Maybe. (looks him in the eye) Yes.
I thought you didn't believe in one.
I don't know. Maybe it just adds up to this.
Maybe that's enough. He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder. She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he pulls her to him, kissing her back. Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending them spinning back into the center of the cabin. She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments, the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors and shapes, like a ticker tape parade. In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love.
I think these are the creatures that built the wormhole. One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.
No. I don't think it's in our universe at all. I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse. And it can only interact with us using gravity. The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the space it's in, stretching the skin. Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body, coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso like a fun house mirror. Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins moving, tugging him gently through the cabin. In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled through the cabin. It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall. Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled around the room.
Where would we even start? Maybe-- She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining globes into the air. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them into patterns in the air. First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around a medium-sized star.
That's us. That's where they've brought us. We're in the bulk. Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static now. Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The instruments on the ship TONE in alarm. Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate.
They're moving us.
How do you know?
Time. That's what the bulk beings wanted to give us. That was the treasure the Chinese found. Enough time to let us save ourselves. Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems in awe of the place.
Because they were too late. By the time they found this place, the people who sent them were dead. They were unable to fulfill their mission. Tars points to the next room.
Where do they lead? Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping some of the wormholes.
But that's impossible... Tars turns away from the machine.
You know it doesn't work. Time travel isn't possible.
Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese would have suddenly discovered all of these incredible technologies. But they never made it.
If you try to use it, you'll die, just like the people who built it. She puts an arm on his shoulder.
Roth was right, Cooper. We have to keep going. Keep exploring. We have an obligation to try to survive. From here we could find a thousand places where life could thrive. And you're going to return to the one place where it can't.
I came to say goodbye. Cooper looks up at her.
This one's done all right by us so far. Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the fractal life-form.
Will you take this with you? It's the last of its kind as well. Thought we should double its chances of survival. In case I'm wrong. Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside, trying to escape. He sets it inside the ship. Turns back to her.
I don't know. Up there, I guess. She points up into the great darkness above them. Tars steps down. Moves over to them.
Come with us. Please. You wanted your whole life to explore. This is your chance. Cooper stares at her. This is what he has always wanted. And he has to turn it down.
You're a man who keeps his promises. Make me one- She takes his hand.
After you're done... come find me.
","It's not responding to the handshake. I can't open anything on primary. Brand looks up at Cooper.
It found something.
Why not? We've tested it a hundred times.
Tars was a Marine. They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better.
I still think we're making a lot of assumptions. About the wormhole. About the planet. (points to map) The critical orbit here is incredibly dangerous. It's like walking on the rim of the volcano.
How do you know that?
I thought you were a scientist, Brand. That sounds more like a hypothesis.
What do you think, Roth? Roth leans forward, studying the map.
So you think we'll have no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet?
If that's not the plan, then what are we supposed to be doing out there?
So is the wormhole. Doyle pats Cooper on the back. Cooper begins hauling gear inside.
I've got a problem over here, too. Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material of the hull. Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him, bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass.
It's not the hull... it's inside the ship... it's...
What the hell are they, Case?
It's getting bigger. Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT. His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled. But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain.
None of our testing involved opening the ship inside the wormhole. We have no idea what might happen.
That's not possible. We haven't activated the engines yet. The ship's skin illuminates, overlaying a plotted course on top of the view.
We're being pulled into it?
You don't know that. Case stares ahead into the darkness.
If the modelling was wrong, then we can't be sure about anything. We need to go back. Case thinks it over. Decides.
I'm sorry. I can't let you kill us. We have to go back. The engines strain to fight the swirl -- but they're hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole.
Why isn't it slowing down?
The Chinese must have captured them. So they couldn't return to us. The crew stare at the probes for a moment, taking it in.
It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet, then stops. Tunnel's old -- the ice has reformed at the bottom.
It would take a thousand feet of ice to shield us. Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice. Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows her.
We'll never make it far enough down.
Why not?
I think we've got a problem. Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed as they move towards them. Roth begins to step out towards them.
Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals.
Look at the size of this place. They built it for thousands of people. But no one came. Brand looks around, determined.
What problem?
I think I know what the problem is. Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up.
Look. Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel.
There's a small black hole moving into the system. Too small for us to have seen in our survey. It's not going to hit the planet, but it's going to come close. A tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree. After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart. Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats -- the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over.
This place isn't paradise. It's doomed. Just like us. The crew stand, watching the sequence in stunned silence.
So much for the plan. Cooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces.
What the hell is happening? Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING under a load it was never built to handle. Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and CRASHES towards them. Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher painting. Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control panel orbits past them back up towards the lab. They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible, dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs. Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the lab. Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab, SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab. Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for him... Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door.
All that from one tiny box. Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to parse how it works. Cooper looks on.
We're not going to stick around to count them. Let's get out of here.
What about the escape rocket at the Chinese base camp? One of us could fit into it.
Sure. But we don't have nearly enough power for lift off. Roth holds up the small gravity black box.
Control systems inside are online.
Close the door. Cooper moves to the door. Something's wrong.
I'm setting a course for the wormhole. They're going to make it. Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below.
My kids... Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.
That's easy for you to say. You didn't leave anyone behind. Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness.
The wormhole. Look -- it's being pulled into the black hole as well. They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit converges on the event horizon of the black hole.
How much time are we losing?
This is it. We're going to be pulled in. Cooper looks at the controls, an idea forming. He pulls himself down. Hauls himself across the deck to pick up Liu's chip. He plugs it into a diagnostic tool.
Hurry up. Cooper concentrates, poring over the numbers. Finally he begins feeding coordinates into the navigation computer.
We only have a few minutes before we're swallowed into that thing. What are we even looking for? On the radar, a tiny empty spot appears.
We're not going to be able to slow down. Hold onto something. He locks up the controls.
They just appeared. A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a point in the middle of the cabin. Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in response. Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points appear, as if they've been summoned by the first. Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of them are motionless.
That's our solar system. After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua, Pantagruel, and the ice planet. Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet. Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.
Where? They stand, looking out into the perfect darkness.
What does it do? Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what it does.
Do you really think it works? Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined.
Let's go home. The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the space station and closes in on the wormhole. Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:
We get back to earth, you and I can try to make sense of the code. Rebuild the gravity machine. Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He unbuckles himself. Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the familiar stars and stripes carved into its side. Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together.
Of course it's going to work.
I don't know what you're talking about, but you're not touching the controls. I'm going home.
You're not stopping me. I'm going home. Doyle forces Cooper into the ship's lander. Then he closes the airlock. Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass, trying to reason with him. The landing craft detaches from the ship.
","No. A black hole. There are several in the region, but this is the largest -- a billion times heavier than the sun. I call it Gargantua.
High speed or high gravity both slow down time, relative to earth.
The trip around the black hole will take us only a few days. But far more time will be passing back home. The ship's trajectory cuts through the deep gravity well of the smaller black hole to reach the ice planet.
Based on the information from the probe -- as much as five years. Doyle looks at the tiny ship's trajectory, threaded between two black holes. He looks worried.
If we're guessing, then I'd say Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't exist naturally. I think it's there for a reason. That someone is trying to help us. Brand looks satisfied.
I think we'll probably be killed. (off his look) I said I thought there was a plan. Not that the plan was for us to find a planet like Earth to save a handful of people.
It's not bending your hand. It's bending the space around your hand. The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is freaking out. The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also. He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and distorting his body.
The wormhole is splitting into two paths. Radiation is pouring from one path to the other.
Look at that. Roth is looking through the translucent panel on the hull. They are on the warped side of the universe.
The smaller black hole. We're much closer to it than the models predicted. We're being pulled by its swirl. Very quickly. The crew looks out through the hull. They are being pulled into Pantagruel's swirl -- a glittering disc of matter spinning at high speed around the hole. Doyle looks behind them. The wormhole mouth is rapidly growing smaller.
No. I don't think so... Roth looks at the instrumentation for a moment.
It appears to be pulling us on exactly the trajectory we modelled. If we try to fight it, we could push ourselves off of that trajectory.
We should turn off the engines. Let the swirl take us.
It's the tidal gravity caused by the black hole. It means we're right on the critical orbit. The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it receives a long garbled update. Then it shuts down. Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls.
We're being pulled towards the event horizon. ALARMS begin sounding throughout the ship as the projected course on Roth's model shifts, showing the Endurance being pushed up the rim, past the critical orbit and down towards the black hole's event horizon. Case takes control of the ship, trying to fire the engines forwards to speed them back up to safety, but it's too late.
They would if we used it all at once. Cooper is still trying to understand what Roth means as Tars locks himself into the engine compartment.
Prime the remaining engine. When he detonates it, we'll only have a few seconds. If we overshoot we could be pulled into the bigger hole. Roth moves to the controls.
He's being pulled toward Gargantua. We can't help him. The crew watch, helpless, as the tones grow further and further apart. Then they stop. Cooper looks at Doyle, anger rising. Then he looks down.
We're here.
I've got a signal. But it's local. A familiar CHIRP plays over the ship's speakers.
The remaining probes. We found them. She looks at the monitor. The probes ping the ship with their locations, which pop up on the monitor. They're all clustered in one spot.
The more immediate question is what happened to the Chinese expedition. There's no sign of their ship in orbit. And they never returned to earth. Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled egg. Virtually none of the rations have been eaten.
I think I know what killed them. This planet isn't the only thing orbiting this black hole. Roth zooms the monitor in, revealing a tiny, impossibly-bright object appearing at the horizon of the black hole.
It's a neutron star. The black hole shields the planet's surface from it for twenty hours at a stretch. Time's about up. Even Brand looks rattled.
About five minutes.
About three minutes or so until we're fully exposed. The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity -- the radiation levels are rising. The ice will not be enough to protect them. Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick. He takes over for her. The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year- old battery runs out of charge. Case casts it aside and begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand. Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for fissures. Her lights pick out something in the ice. She
It's not your light they're responding to. It's this-- Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice. Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine.
Not enough, unfortunately. Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. Cooper looks down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them.
She's still taking samples. If you find her, tell her to head back. Night should be falling soon.
Your guess is as good as mine. Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand.
Fascinating. I think- Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the shelter after Doyle. Case pushes the door closed.
They were testing something. Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards.
The control panel is beneath you. See if you can turn it off.
Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it up, or down. I think they were experimenting with it -- firing these into the black hole to try to save this planet.
It means whoever built the wormhole probably doesn't exist inside our universe. Cooper looks at the tiny box.
They came back here and tried to use these devices to save this planet. But they didn't work. Nothing would be strong enough to weaken a black hole.
No. You're missing the bigger picture. The robots had strict mission parameters. They were told to build a colony and report back. They tried to. But they failed. Like us they were fixated on this place. Cooper looks at Brand.
They didn't realize they had already found something that would save us all. (holds up the box) This. This is the prize. He holds up the box.
Don't you see? Earth's gravity is like a prison. But this is like a master key.
If we could build more of these, we could turn down the earth's gravitational field enough to save millions of people. We wouldn't have to pick a handful of people to survive. With this we can save everyone.
Wherever we want. We don't belong in any one place. Can't you see that now? Not Earth. Not this place. Nowhere. If the human race is going to survive, we need to keep moving. Split up. Spread out. Fly. With this, we can. Case looks at the box. Makes a decision.
Following? Following where? Liu pauses.
Your name means six. Where did the others go? One through five? Is that who were not supposed to follow. Case turns to look at Cooper.
Can the secondary thrusters still fire on the lander? Doyle looks over the craft.
I can reach one of the moons in low orbit and turn up its gravity. As it passes overhead it should be able to slingshot the lander away from the planet's surface.
You don't need this -- only the idea. The knowledge of how to build it. Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter.
Not me. But you'll make it work. The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and takes the black box himself.
This is a one-way trip for me. Before Cooper can respond, Roth heads for the door.
This is the only way. Keep the lander upright and fire the secondary boosters when the moon passes overhead.
No. You need to make it home. You're going to need to build more of these. Brand looks at him, heartbroken. Roth smiles.
I understand the plan, now. Whatever happens, you have to keep exploring. Keep learning. One good idea isn't enough. You'll need more and more of them just to survive. Do you understand?
Go. Brand turns to follow Cooper back. Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud. In seconds it's high overhead.
","My dad can fix anything.
I... I think the patch kit might not be there... (off his look) Because I was using it for my bike. Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.
Is that really why I'm named Murph, dad?
Why?
What are you going to do with it?
I got suspended. Paul said anyone who believed we went to the moon was an idiot. So I hit him.
Where is that, dad?
But what about its mission? What about the information onboard?
Try a different direction. As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.
What are we doing today?
But what if there is, dad? What if there's something we can salvage? Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
I think it's home. Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat grassland in the center of the island.
Dad, what are these things?
Is it still... alive?
But can't we take it back? You could fix it up, get him to do chores.
What are they doing, dad?
I've been doing the math, dad. I weigh about 85 pounds. Now that's an extra ton of fuel. But if-
You're not coming back, are you?
Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch. He laughs, self-conscious.
It's your 60th birthday today. Thought I would celebrate with you a bit.
Rot's setting in. I guess you were right for clearing out while you had the chance. (reaches up to switch
It's done. Auto-pilot's packed up for the last time.
Can't do anything for you. There aren't any more parts for these. Not anywhere.
All right. Let me get my jacket. Murph picks up his jacket from the workbench. Next to it on the bench is a shortwave radio playing STATIC.
I have no idea. Murph switches off the lights and they walk out. After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness.
Where's Emily?
Do you remember what you changed? Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. Then nods.
