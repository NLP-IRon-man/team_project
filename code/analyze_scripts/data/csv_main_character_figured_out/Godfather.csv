txt,"I told you I had a lot of relatives. KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop. We see what she sees: Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine barrels.
They're waiting to see my father.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
No. His name is Luca Brasi. You wouldn't like him.
(Sizing her up) You really want to know?
You like spaghetti?
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story. She starts to eat her spaghetti. She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business. They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them. He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then the legs at the knees...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Then Luca turned to the other man...
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated. The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
Thanks Tom. HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously following.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in. He's a good lawyer.
Sure.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career. JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight. They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.
Tom said he'd take care of it. The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through the gate of the great Corleone Mall.
For bravery.
For killing a man.
I fought for my country. It was my choice.
I'm going to finish school.
And what do you want for Christmas?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night. He moves to the telephone.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.
Hello, Tom? Michael. Yeah... listen, we haven't left yet. I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning. There's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas. Will he be home tomorrow night?
No.
I'm thinking about it.
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. She cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points. His face goes grave. The headlines read: ""VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
(desperately) They don't say if he's dead or alive.
Thanks. He moves to THERESA.
(gently) You heard from Tom yet? Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the room; everyone speaks in a whisper.
(taking her hand) C'mon. He leads her into his father's office without knocking.
How's Mom?
I can help you out...
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
What?
Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.
How can you be sure?
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.
(softly) That's not how Pop would have played it.
(calmly) All right, Sonny. All right.
Is it like they say? Is he that good? Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief. Then open the door and rush out. Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped in a tight embrace with his WIFE.
Hello. Kay?
He'll be OK.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Huh?
I can't...
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
To the city.
I don't need them, Sonny. I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I don't think so either. (silence) I better go.
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over. He leans over her; kisses her.
Goodbye. Quietly, he moves out the door. KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:
Hello? Hello? Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, alertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all alone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
You just stand here one minute... Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital. I came down late. There's no one here. None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one. The old man is completely unprotected.
(furiously, but kept inside) I won't panic. He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...
(coldly) You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
You've read about my father in the papers. You've seen that no one's here to guard him. Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. Believe me and help me.
Hurry, into there. They push it into the first available room. MICHAEL peeks out from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they emerge. It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers.
(stepping out) Who is it?
Enzo, get out of here. There's going to be trouble. A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.
Go outside; stand in front...I'll be out in a minute.
Pop...Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh, don't try to speak. There are men who are coming to try to kill you. But I'm with you...I'm with you now... The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.
Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket. The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas decorations.
Listen... We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. MICHAEL and ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket. They stand, hands in their pockets. A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them. MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates. MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they are not. Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital, getting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief. In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed POLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts toward them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red face and white hair seems furious. This is McCLUSKEY.
(quietly) What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father?
I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room.
(deliberately, right to McCLUSKEY's face, as he's being handcuffed) How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain? Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength. MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive.
Christ, Sonny really means business. They continue walking. TESSIO joins them. The various BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.
Cut it out.
We can't wait. No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop. You have to get Sollozzo now.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey. We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo. Set up the meeting for two days from now. Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour. So I'll feel safe. They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me. (pause) Then I'll kill them both. Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL. Silence. SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. He points a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.
(angrily, but cold) Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather. He took my joining the Marines personal. I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny. MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.
How bad will it be?
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
A million times.
O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
I want to settle things tonight. I want my father left alone.
We're going to New Jersey?
(using English for emphasis) Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom? SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with his dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.
Now I can talk. I feel much better. The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now he too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton his jacket. SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear him. The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his temple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the entire area. The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is sprayed and stained with blood. SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he seems to hang in space suspended. MICHAEL pivots, and looks: There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth. MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat. He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull. The air is filled with pink mist. MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall. He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed. Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty. The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an expression of horror on his face. MICHAEL looks at his two victims: SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by the table. McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table. MICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN. He moves, not letting the gun go. MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression. His hand: still holding the gun. His face: finally he closes his eyes. His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud. He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back. He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had been recreated in wax. Then he leaves.
Don Tommassino.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
Corleone.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Don Tommassino...I should see this place. DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone. The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.
How do you know I come from America?
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Yes.
(sternly) Shhhhh. He settles down to watch. The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but developed and womanly. They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove. Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully, in the direction of the grove. The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws them back at her pursuers laughing. They come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the view of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about to run. MICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks. Her face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair and a rich mouth.
What are you talking about?
She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair. She looks more Greek than Italian. Do you know a beauty like that? As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl.
Innkeeper. More wine!
Tell him to come to me. The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI between them.
(quietly) I understand I've offended you by talking about your daughter. I offer you my apologies, I'm a stranger in this country, I don't know the customs very well. Let me say this, I meant no disrespect to you or her... CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.
I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country. My name is Michael. You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. In any case, I want to meet your daughter. With your permission and under the supervision of your family. With all decorum. With all respect. I am an honorable man. CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then asks:
When the proper time comes, I'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know.
Your daughter's name?
It's safer to teach you English.
Ciao, Don Tommassino. APPOLONIA kisses him.
Things went badly in Palermo?
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
What is it?
Get the car. I'll be leaving in ten minutes. Where's Calo?
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
No, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?
Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car. He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee. He looks out from the opening in the doorway.
(muttering to himself) Where the hell is he going? MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside. MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes. APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is.
No. No! His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION, as she switched on the ignition. Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia. MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.
Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in Sicily.
(pained) No.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice. From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
You wanted me to be your son.
Then why have I become a man like you?
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
You look good, too. They enter the suite.
(dryly) No.
Come here a minute, Fredo. FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.
Who are those girls?
Give them some money and send them home.
Get rid of them...
Johnny, the Corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the Olive Oil business and settling here. Moe Greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the family. FREDDIE seems anxious.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.
Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started. We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers. We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. We hope your friends in the movies will do the same. We count on you to convince them.
Thanks.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out? MOE laughs.
The hotel, the casino. The Corleone family wants to buy you out. GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense. NERI eyes the BODYGUARDS.
Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better.
(the worst insult) You're unlucky.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino. You and the Corleone family are evened out. This is for business; name your price.
(quietly, deadly) Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow. Think of your price.
The Don has semi-retired. I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me. Nobody answers. MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door. MOE exits angrily.
Freddie, you're my older brother. I love you. But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Let HER ask. NERI opens the door. KAY wants to talk just a little more.
I'm busy.
Let me think about it, O.K.? She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.
In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own. Carlo, I'm counting on you to make the move to Nevada; you'll be my right-hand man out there. Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliere. Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction. He remains inexpressive.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas. Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it. Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Maybe less...
No. I want things very calm for another six months.
All I can say is that things are being resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets. Understood? There are uneasy looks all around.
I'll come to you when I need you. He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod, reluctantly.
All right, then it's resolved. NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door. CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave, then CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man. Then NERI closes the door. MICHAEL relaxes.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.
How did you find out?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
(coldly) You're out, Tom. TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence. TOM leaves. MICHAEL looks at NERI.
I'm going to talk to my father. NERI nods, and then leaves. The DON opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside.
I'll need him.
How?
Yes.
I've always respected you... A long silence. The DON smiles at MICHAEL.
He talked to you?
(softly) Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. I really needed him.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. (he looks at TOM) I guess you've figured it all out?
I know now. (a passion wells up inside of MICHAEL) I'll make them call me Don.
(nods) A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe. HAGEN looks at him; understands.
But after the Baptism. I've decided to stand as godfather to Connie's baby. They look up. The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel, with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.
Yes, I promise.
I do renounce him.
I do renounce them.
I do wish to be baptized.
Carlo...we've had a change in the plans. Mama, Connie, Kay and the kids will have to take the trip out to Vegas without us.
Go back to your house and wait for me... He kisses KAY.
(to KAY) I'll just be a couple of days... People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to drive off.
You have to answer for Santino. The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. That little farce you played out with my sister. Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
(quietly) Barzini is dead. So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did. CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.
(almost kindly) Don't be frightened. Do you think I'd make my sister a widow? Do you think I'd make your children fatherless? After all, I'm Godfather to your son. No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there. I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry. Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
(softly) Good, good. Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport. CARLO moves to the door; opens it. There is a car waiting; with a group of MEN around it. He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.
I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on.
(smiles) Speak your mind.
No. This I have to do.
Sit in the car.
Where's the boss?
Get her home and get a doctor. The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her, gently but firmly. KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from MICHAEL. He feels her look.
She's hysterical. But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.
Don't ask me.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
(after a very long pause) No. KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs him. Then she kisses him.
","(nodding) It will cost. The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE nods.
Who do I give this job to? The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.
Francesco Nippi. His nephew has been refused parole. A bad case.
You understand him better than anyone. The DON nods to this. Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.
Hello Kay. Your father's inside, doing some business. (privately) He's been asking for you.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand. Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo. DON CORLEONE is not pleased.
The action is narcotics. Sollozzo has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, in Sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin. Also he has access to this country. He's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law. For that we get a piece of the action, I couldn't find out how much. Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action. They call Sollozzo the Turk. He's spent a lot of time in Turkey and is suppose to have a Turkish wife and kids. He's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger. Only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint. Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family man. THE DON nods.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States. He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
This morning.
Should I bring him in.
It's been two years. He's probably in trouble again.
Sonny? Then he goes up.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait. He won't last out the night. This saddens the DON. He sighs.
Understood.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
I'm German-Irish.
It's from Johnny. It was announced this morning. He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
Right. He smiles. MICHAEL has hung up. He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it. He rises, puts on his coat and hat, and continues out. He peeks into the DON's office.
Michael called; he's not leaving New Hampshire until tomorrow morning. I've got to go, I promised Theresa I'd pick up some toys for the kids. The DON smiles and nods. TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE. FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the afternoon paper. He puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the paper.
I haven't got time. TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.
(pulling himself together) Sonny will come after you with everything he's got. SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
If I plead before the Supreme Court, I'll never do better than I did tonight with that Turk.
Is the hospital covered?
Too much, too far, too personal. The Don would consider this all purely a business dispute: Get rid of Sollozzo, and everything falls in line. YOU don't have to go after the Tattaglias. CLEMENZA nods.
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. That worries me.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through. Mike, keep ringing Luca's number. MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again. He can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers. Then hangs up.
Keep trying every fifteen minutes. (exhausted)
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength. Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war. The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
(quietly) I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
We're all tired...
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly. You know the old man doesn't want that.
Was there a definite proposal?
What about that Tattaglias? What will they do about Bruno?
We should hear what they have to say.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this. This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain. Never. It would be disastrous. All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover. So just...take that into consideration.
What about McCluskey?
We don't let Mike go until we have the hostage, Sonny.
No. Our informer in McCluskey's precinct. Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx. Anyone know it.
(starting to crack) Jesus, I don't know...
Kay, we weren't expecting you. You should call...
Nobody knows where he is. We know he's all right, but that's all. KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with rainwater.
An accident. No one was hurt.
Sure...I'm sorry. They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you. We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.
Mama, no.
...since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on most of our operations...on the other families too. There's been a lot of bad blood. The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up. The OLD MAN nods.
Michael... (he takes a breath) It was Michael who killed Sollozzo. The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and rage.
He's safe now...we're already working on ways to bring him back. The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again. We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
Yes. That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Go after him.
(quietly) OK. Go to Clemenza's house and tell him to come here right away. He'll tell you what to do. The MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the middle of the living room a moment. He looks in the direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA moving around.
(quietly) I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. Just now.
Yes.
They shot Sonny on the Causeway. (pause) He's dead. DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
You owe the Don a service. He has no doubt that you will repay it.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
You mean Tattaglia.
(a revelation) He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime. Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing. They get a little more money than the job's worth. (pause) Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Mike, why am I out?
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
Maybe I can help.
Did he give you his politicians?
How will they come at you?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
You'd better make your call to Barzini; Michael's ready. TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.
(gravely) I'm sure he will.
(gently) I can't go with you either, Tessio. He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he panics, and then he accepts it.
He understands that. TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.
I can't. HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group. Then about twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back. TESSIO is led into a waiting car. HAGEN looks away, and walks off.
","He'll be here Pop, it's still early.
Sandra, watch the kids. They're running wild.
Buddy, this is a private party. The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the sedan. SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him. The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word. SONNY steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE, and another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.
Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.
And Michael?
It's me, Sonny. The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling him into the apartment.
The Tattaglia family guarantees our investment? SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out of line.
Yeah.
I think so. Detective squad?
Is he alive?
Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming. (click) SONNY cradles the phone. An incredible rage builds up in him, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip the phone to pieces in his bare hands. Then he controls it. Quickly, he dials another number.
Theresa, let me talk to Tom. Not yet? Have him call me as soon as he gets home. He hangs up.
(calmly) They shot the old man.
Honey...don't worry. Nothing else is going to happen. There is a POUNDING on the door. A BABY starts crying.
Yeah.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
No, just you and Paulie. CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.
A couple of our people will come to stay here. Do whatever they say; I'm going over to the main house. If you want me, use Pop's special phone. The telephone rings again. SONNY answers it.
Hello.
Yeah.
(quietly) I'll wait.
Ma? Ma, where are you. The kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes her by the arm. He is deliberately calm.
Ma, I just got a call. Pop's hurt...I don't know how bad.
(almost in tears) We don't know yet, Ma.
Tessio...This is Santino Corleone. I want fifty reliable men out here.
I don't want to use Clemenza's people right now. Understood? He hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger. We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA BRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.
Luca.
Don't worry, Theresa; they just want to give Tom the proposition, then they're going to turn him loose. He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise, he kisses him on the cheek.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Good. She's been through it before. Me too. You were too young to know about it. You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Theresa. She understands, and leaves them alone.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
One of them fingered the old man. MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building. We got people in the phone company. (he shrugs) Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad. MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the situation.
Until the old man tells me different.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs. I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. I don't care if we all go down together.
I know I'm not the man he was. But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. What about the hit list. HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
(angry) That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances. Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city. The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day. There is a timid knock on the door.
What is it? PAULIE GATTO looks in.
Tessio, see what it is. TESSIO gets up, leaves.
Yeah. Hang around.
Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show. That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone. MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected. He dials Luca Brasi's number once again. The ring repeats, but no one answers. TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest in his hand. He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped inside.
You take care of Paulie?
Where are you going?
(to Clemenza; dipping bread into the sauce) Send some bodyguards.
OK, but be careful.
I've got a hundred button men on the streets twenty-four hours a day. If Sollozzo shows one hair on his ass he's dead. He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand, kiddingly.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
The Turk wants to talk! The nerve of that son of a bitch! After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
No, no Consiglere. Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks. Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all out war. We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
And when they shot me father...
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom. You just help me win. Understood? HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.
(still fuming) McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever. We'll wait.
The kid's right.
Go on Mike.
You? You, the high-class college kid. You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business. Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face. You're taking it personal, it's just business and he's taking it personal. Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps his face serious.
What are you, inspecting the barracks? (SONNY sits up with his head in his hands) You ready? Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
That could be a Tattaglia informer with the meeting place.
One of Tattaglia's people?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
(to MICHAEL, warmly) You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Probably a year...
Can you do it Mike? MICHAEL moves out.
Yeah. The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars.
It's me, Sonny. We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him.
(tenderly) Connie, what is it? He turns her around in his arms. Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time. As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment.
I'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you. He starts to leave.
Hey. Con. What'm I goin' to do? Make your kid a orphan before he's born. She laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.
You...bastard...You...hurt my sister... again...and I'll kill...you. He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly. and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, leaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially interested. CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps onto the stoop.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
Freddie's gonna go to Las Vegas...under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A. I want him to rest...
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks. I want to get things going good before he gets better. What's the matter with you?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Well it's war! We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop had Genco, who do I have? (TOM starts to leave) Hey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner. Don't be sore.
Yeah Connie.
(in a controlled voice) You wait there. You just wait there. He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.
(quietly) That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch... HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he cannot interfere.
","Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
And what is that Bonasera? BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.
No. You ask for too much.
The Court gave you justice.
But your daughter is still alive.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends. You think it's enough to be an American. All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship. And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera. But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you... Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.
Good. From me you'll get Justice.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
Where's Michael?
Then the picture will wait for him. Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves back to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns it. Then he moves to his wife.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
You want him to stay in this country.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Not to one of our paisans...give it to a Jew Congressman in another district. Who else is on the list for today? The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting to see him.
Is it necessary?
Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend. THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
And with prison record.
When did he call?
On a day like this. Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now. Write that down before you forget it. The Turk will wait. We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers from outside. In Italian, with unmistakable style.
What that? It sounds like Johnny. He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the room with light.
It is Johnny. He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.
My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat. At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
Tell Santino to come in with us. He should hear some things. They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.
ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in Heaven, is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood finocchio. Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON smiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still adjusting his clothes.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
You take care of your family?
You look terrible. I want you to eat well, to rest. And spend time with your family. And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt.
Now go back to the party and leave it to me. He closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
Genco will wait for me. Santino, tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco. Tell Fredo to drive the big car, and ask Johnny to come with us.
All my sons. (to HAGEN) Tom, I want you to go to California tonight. Make the arrangements. But don't leave until I come back from the hospital and speak to you. Understood?
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What was this for?
And this?
What miracles you do for strangers.
And now, what do you choose to do?
Good. When you are finished, come and talk to me. I have hopes for you. Again they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns, and continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then follows.
(whispered) Genco, I've brought my sons to pay their respects. And look, even Johnny Fontane, all the way from Hollywood. GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.
I have no such power...but Genco, don't fear death.
You blaspheme. Resign yourself.
Luca, I am worried about this man Sollozzo. Find out what you can, through the Tattaglias. Let them believe you could be tempted away from the Corleone Family, if the right offer was made. Learn what he has under his fingernails...
Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns.
Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family? SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.
So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
I said I would see you because I've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect... (pause) But I'll say no to you. We feel this around the room.
I'll give you my reasons. I have many, many friends in Politics. But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling. They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice...and they think narcotics is dirty business. SOLLOZZO takes a breath.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business. But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
No.
Young people are greedy, and they have no manners. They speak when they should listen. But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see. But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He glances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do as well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard: The DON turns to SONNY.
Santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking. I think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl. TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display with the word ""THANK YOU"" spelled out in flowers.
What is this nonsense?
Send Johnny my congratulations.
Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; I'll be ready to go home in a few minutes.
That's the third time this month. I think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me. Tell Tom.
Merry Christmas. (handing the MANAGER an envelope) And he starts down the stairs.
Fredo, Fredo! The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots. Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain, and continues toward the car. The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking over an entire case of fruit. The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off. Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. There are more GUNSHOTS. FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having difficulty opening the door. He rushes out, a gun trembling in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops the gun. The gun falls amid the rolling fruit. The GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed DON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and pools of blood are beginning to form. The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came. The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows. But the street itself is now empty. FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and face down in them. FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying something we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.
Well my friend, are you ready to do me this service? BONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.
(staring at the table) I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me. I do not want his mother to see him as he is. He draws down the gray blanket. BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees: The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.
Give me a drop of anisette. HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
But you needed a drink first.
Now you've had your drink. Pause.
I want no inquiries made. No acts of vengeance. (pause) Consigliere, arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families...this war stops now. He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...
Call Bonasera...he will do me a service. And leaves. HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...
Ah well, let's get down to business. We are all honorable men here, we don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers. (he sits, gazes out at them, and sighs) How did things ever go so far? Well, no matter. A lot of foolishness has come to pass. It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary. The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during the day's trading, and projected above. DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.
Tattaglia has lost a son; I have lost a son. We are quits. Let there be a peace... (he gestures expressively, submissively, with his hands) That is all I want...
My friends, I didn't refuse out of malice. You all know me. When have I ever refused an accommodation? But why, this time? Because I think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come. It's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the Church and the Government. But drugs? No. Even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs. But...I am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary.
I forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good. But I have selfish reasons. My youngest son had to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, and I must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges. That is my affair, and I will make those arrangements. (with strength) But I am a superstitious man...and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then I will blame some of the people here. That, I could never forgive, but...aside from that, let me swear by the souls of my Grandchildren that I will never be the one to break the peace we have made.
Mention it, don't insist. Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
(shaking his head) Barzini.
Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. But I wasn't sure until this day. No, it was Barzini all along. The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.
Be my son...
This old building has seen its day. No way to do business...too small, too old. They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.
Have you thought about a wife? A family?
I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
No, I wanted other things for you.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men. I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over. That was my misfortune. That was your misfortune. I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was. I had no choice.
What else do you believe in? MICHAEL doesn't answer.
Believe in a family. Can you believe in your country? Those Pezzonovante of the State who decide what we shall do with our lives? Who declare wars they wish us to fight in to protect what they own. Do you put your fate in the hands of men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people to vote for them? Michael, in five years the Corleone family can be completely legitimate. Very difficult things have to happen to make that possible. I can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to. MICHAEL listens.
Believe in a family; believe in a Code of Honor, older and higher, believe in Roots that go back thousands of years into your Race. Make a family, Michael, and protect it. These are our affairs, sono cosa nostra, Governments only protect men who have their own individual power. Be one of those men...you have the choice.
My son is head of the Family now. If you have his permission, you have my good will.
Do you have faith in my judgement?
Then do what Michael says...
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace. He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune. Michael has all my confidence, as you do. For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed. They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out ""Kill me, kill me."" Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon. Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him. I think you have done the same with this man. They walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting. MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. Then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.
Barzini will move against you first.
He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety... He rises, and looks at Michael...
...and at that meeting you will be assassinated. The DON walks on further.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Good. MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:
And I...you.
","Paulie...wine...WINE. He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief. PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings it to him.
What are you, a dance judge? Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay. PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps back into the dance. The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another number in the notebook. TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR- OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes. The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by CLEMENZA and PAULIE.
(excited) You heard about your father?
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Maybe three, four times. I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no. Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Your mother's at the hospital with the old man: He's gonna pull through. MICHAEL nods his relief.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Outside.
Understood.
A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
Crazy Detroit delivered it with a wooden bumper. They're going to send me the chrome bumpers in a couple months. I waited two years for this car to come with wooden bumpers! He scrubs and polishes with great affection.
Today you make your bones on Paulie. You understand everything?
.22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up to five feet. LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into the driveway, and he sounds the horn. The two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit nervous, like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of recognition. He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting to chide PAULIE for being late. PAULIE flinches a little when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:
Goddamn Sonny. He's running scared. He's already thinking of going to the mattresses. We have to find a place on the West Side. Paulie, you know a good location? PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook he was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling Sollozzo any secret location.
(grunting) Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month! The car pulls out.
Pay attention!
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'. The car pulls off.
You wait; I'll call. He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.
He talked my ear off. Want us to go back to Long Beach; have another job for us. Rocco, you live in the City, can we drop you off?
OK, then you gotta come back. The car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and secure.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Paulie, pull over. I gotta take a leak. The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him. He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there are two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, moving back to the car. PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered.
Leave the gun. LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.
Some dame. MICHAEL picks it up.
How come you don't tell that nice girl you love her...here, learn something... you may have to feed fifty guys some day. You start with olive oil...fry some garlic, see. And then fry some sausage...or meat balls if you like...then you throw in the tomatoes, the tomato paste...some basil; and a little red wine...that's my trick. SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.
You won't see Paulie anymore. He's sick for good this winter. MICHAEL starts to leave.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
How come all the new men?
Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip out. Everybody will still think you got it. They'll be starin' at your face, see? Then walk out of the place real fast, but don't run. Don't look anybody directly in the eye, but don't look away from them neither. Hey, they'll be scared stiff o you, believe me. Nobody's gonna bother with you. Don't worry about nothing; you'd be surprised how good these things go. O.K., put your hat on, let's see how you look. Helps with identification. They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light. Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
Probably all the other families will line up against us. But, it's alright. These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
It's okay...the hostage is outside playing pinochle with three of my men. The phone rings in the DON's office.
Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the car. You'll be clean so they won't worry 'bout nothing. In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go. See? Then when you come out, don't waste time; don't sit down...you come out blasting. And don't take chances. In the head, two shots apiece. And out as fast as your legs can move.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
You said there would come a day when Tessio and me could form our own Families. Only with your benediction, of course. I ask permission...
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
And I don't like Barzini. I say the Corleone Family has to move from strength, not weakness. We should build our Regimes and take back our lost territories in Staten Island, at least.
Yes, Godfather...
Don Corleone... The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her husband has become.
