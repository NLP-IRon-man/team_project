txt,"Sorry. He steps aside. Beverly tip-toes past, lighting a cigarette like a pro.
Ballyhoo?
Barnburner. Beverly smiles and offers Ben a smoke. He refuses. She shrugs and blows a smoke ring in his face.
Thanks.
I just know `cuz we were in social studies. Together, in the same class. You know, like the constitution test, and stuff. (realizing he's vomiting
I fell on three boxes of donuts. Beverly laughs.
Uh, you too, Beverly. ""Stay cool."" Ben watches her go, totally smitten.
I like it in here. It's-- He glances at a newspaper behind her: ""BODY FOUND NEAR CANAL NOT THAT OF COEN YOUTH, BORTON ANNOUNCES."" Safe.
Inspiring. Mrs. Starret smiles sweetly at this large boy.
I'm reading about the history of this place. You know how many spooky things have--
(whispering it outloud) Your hair is winter fire,
You better quit, I swear. Travis pulls a BUCK KNIFE from his jeans. Ben's eyes go wide.
Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you want!
Ben.
Thanks for helping me.
Beverly was there?
And she stole this stuff for me? Stanley wants Ben to shut up, but Ben is beyond excited.
Did she know it was for me?
My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't be late for curfew.
It's funny, `til the last week I didn't think anyone knew my name.
Oh, uh, when I first moved here I didn't have anyone to play with or anything, so I just started hanging out in the Library. All of the boys turn and look at Ben. Seriously?
I don't know. There's just a lot of that here. Been that way since the original settlers. Will, who was more interested in a Viewmaster, turns and looks at the walls now. Sees a copy of an old-timey document with 300 signatures. INCORPORATION OF THE TOWNSHIP OF DERRY.
Derry started as a logging camp before it was officially on any maps. 300 people signed the charter that made Derry Derry. A month later they all disappeared, without a trace.
The people, the livestock, everything that was alive.
People in neighboring settlements thought it was Indians or something but there was no sign of an attack. The only clue was a well house that was burnt down to charcoal.
It was here. Right on the corner of what's now Witcham and Jackson.
I don't know. It was just a way to kill time, I guess.
I'll go.
What's grey water?
Very funny, Richie.
You mean how all sorts of disasters and disappearances and stuff keeps on happening here?
The clown? Will, Stan and Eddie look at Ben.
Isn't he at work?
A clown.
But you adults aren't doing anything!
Hey Richie. Eat a bag of dicks. BOOM. Again, the sky erupts in dazzling light and color AND CONTINUES TO with fireworks THROUGHOUT AND UNTIL THE END OF
Into one freaky looking clown you mean. That's the only form that seems to repeat.
Beverly's right. We can't always hide from them. We need to do something.
Fuck. Will sees this.
The house. It's our only chance! Ben points to the Neibolt Street house on stilts over the black water. An imploded, condemned structure that slopes like a man's half eaten face. Eddie is instantly horrified.
No. I'll go.
Guys, uh-- He looks at their feet. They all do. Water coming in fast. Ben bangs a coal stoker against the boarded window. Rock solid. Will looks for a way out. The stairs.
The front door is right there. Will nods. Let's go.
Eddie, what are you doing? Eddie turns towards them, realizes he must have lost consciousness for a second, doesn't understand why he was standing there. He walks towards the window when THE FLOOR GIVES WAY and he tumbles down to the first floor.
We can't leave him alone down there. Mike looks at the old moldy mattress.
Guys, I hate to pile on bad news. Ben noses up to the window, Mrs. Kaspbrack's TV set flashing in the dark. They all nose up, see what Ben sees.
The only losers in town-
And that is the story of the Silver Dollar Saloon. They look horrified.
That clown, whatever ""IT"" is, has been around Derry doing nasty things for a long long time. The Black Spot fire. The Bradley Gang massacre. All the way back to the first settlers who disappeared. Richie holds up a dog-eared copy of ""A History of Old Derry"".
This storm is crazy. Like the sky's gonna fall. SLAM! Everyone looks back towards the door, blown open by the wind, and at Eddie, who sheepishly was trying to slip in.
How'd you escape?
If it means protecting Beverly, count me in. Beverly looks at Ben, consistently impressed by his defense of her.
Oh, fuck! Will grabs Bev's hand, who grabs Ben's who grab's Eddie's and on down the line. They follow Will around the cellar hold to a giant conveyor belt toppled against the edge. They scale down it into the chasm, bullets pinging around them. CLICK CLICK CLICK. Travis runs out of ammo. He throws the gun away and pulls out the bloody knife.
Shit, ""IT"" has a name. Footsteps echo from behind them.
No no no no no! Guys! Travis bears down, his knife clenched in his teeth.
Oh my God oh my God oh my God.
You think?
Not funny, Richie. He looks back and sees no one. Richie is a couple of lengths to his left.
Guys. I don't think this is the best place to hang out right now.
Charge!
We're dead. So dead.
","Soooo, you gonna let me go by or is there a secret password or something? He turns to see Beverly.
""Sorry""'s not much of a password. Now ""kittyhawk,"" that's a good one.
Riproar.
If you're worried about Bowers and his merry band of a-holes hassling you, don't. I saw them all leave out front.
You're the new kid right? I'm--
(off Ben's look) I slipped in the shower. What's your excuse?
Well, see ya around Ben from sosh class. ""Get laid in the shade.""
Yeah, Mommy? Mrs. Marsh sounds like she might be on sedatives.
What Mommy?
No. Why?
Your friend there. He has that thingy he always carries around in his cute little fannypack right?
Yeah. For when he spazzes out.
Whatever. The point is he has a track record right? Of spazzing out.
I knew I shouldn't `a given him that granola. Mr. Keene!
My mom doesn't like me handling needles. Annoyed, Keene comes out from behind the counter. He kneels next to Eddie and takes the pen, plunging it into his thigh. Will screens Beverly as she SHOPLIFTS THE SUPPLIES and SLIPS OUT THE STORE. Eddie opens his eyes, breathing normal.
Not bad for a bunch of amateurs. She flashes a pack of STOLEN CIGARETTES and struts off towards her house. THEY LOVE THIS GIRL. Will closes Eddie's mouth and they hustle round the corner into RICHARD'S ALLEY.
Is s-someone there? Nothing. BEV'S EYE PEERS DOWN THROUGH THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT.
Who are you? The single voice turns into a cacophony, bubbling up through the ages.
The bathroom! Daddy, in the
No... the sink... in the sink... He stalks past, dragging her behind him. They step into...
The sink... I was... I thought I saw a spider... Uncertain whether he'll hit her anyway, she closes her eyes and prepares for a smacking.
Yes, sir. I'm sorry for waking you. He lowers his hand, gentle now, proprietary.
Because you love momma?
Have you been seeing ""things"" Will? Will whips his neck to Beverly. He can't tell if she is making fun or if she is seriously asking him for a bridge.
I need to show you guys something.
My Daddy will kill me if he finds out I had boys in our apartment.
Sometimes he comes home for a nap.
My Daddy? Mean. Like a drunk. Will, Richie and Eddie go with Bev.
In there.
You'll see.
You really see it?
The sink. It came out from the sink. My parents couldn't see it. I thought I was going crazy. Will goes to Eddie, who still stands frozen in terror.
Or blood in my sink?
I am now. Thanks to you guys. The window slams shut behind them just as Mr. Marsh enters the hallway. He sees a bloody rag on the counter and picks it up, wiping his sweaty face, smearing blood all over it.
But we're not lying.
Nice stick, Richie. How about this. She opens her backpack, revealing a MORTAR with SIX turrets.
I think it depends. Beverly looks up from a SPREAD OF FIREWORKS laid out on a red white and blue Captain America towel.
Wow, you really don't know shit about girls do you? Will smiles.
""IT"" showered me in blood because I just got my period... and... Eddie recoils in disgust while Beverly's mind goes to dark places, to her father, and what being a ""woman"" might mean to him now. Ben and Will both notice this change in her demeanor.
Adults just ignore them. But kids, like your brother, Georgie...
That's cowardly, Stan.
Woah! THUMP. This one knocks her to the ground as the second mortar flies right towards the Trans Am. Travis yanks the wheel to the LEFT as the firework EXPLODES on the side of the car. He slams on the breaks as Victor, Snatch, and Moose are flung forward. Victor smashes his face on the dash board.
Will, we need cover--
Rock, paper, scissors?
It's just a scrape.
What is it Eddie?
What exactly did you see here, Eddie? Ben goes to the window they came through, but instead of seeing out, it's now covered by the 2x4.
What's happening?!
We have to do something. She looks around.
Follow me! Beverly leads Richie and Stan down to the edge of the roof.
I don't know, Richie.
That can't be true. We just saw
We hurt it at Neibolt. That's gotta mean something.
He's just scared.
My friend's party. I told ma--
No one. He shoves her against the wall, eyes her little body up and down. Caresses her hair.
I know daddy.
They're my friends, daddy. He squeezes her cheeks with one hand, holding her head in place.
I-- I swear. They're just friends.
I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just like you raised me.
It's nothing, daddy. Just a poem.
I told you I don't have one.
Daddy stop. You're hurting me.
Nothing. Please, daddy. You don't have to worry. I promise. Please!
What?
Daddy, please. He slides off his belt and grabs her, smiling, a smile that feels all too reminiscent of a clown.
No. No I'm not. She looks back over her shoulder, terrified and wet and shivering.
No. My daddy. He... he...
I don't know. I don't know if it was him, or...
I think ""IT"" was there, controlling him, I don't know, I can't go back, I can't go back, Will. I don't know
It was like that lumberjack Ben told us about. The one from the Silver Dollar. He had this look. Like someone was pushing him to do it.
I can't go back there guys. He'll kill me. Or worse. This sinks in to everyone. There's only one thing they can do.
Now what?
Take off your shoes. You'll be fine. Just move real real slow. Ben, Mike and Will take off their sneaks and crawl across the membrane with great care. SPIDERS GATHER wherever they press a knee or hand, the whole thing sloshing like a water bed.
Guess I'm going first again?
The water. There's something in the water with us.
Break into our homes, we break into yours. Pennywise pulls the arrow from his bloody mouth.
Will, it's a trick.
Finish him, Will. For all of us. For Georgie. Will looks to the scared little boy on the ground.
Guys, stop it. Focus. Everyone turns to Bev. Their muse. Their light.
Will? Stan sees an OBJECT GLITTER in the sunlight. He picks it up, face sober and thoughtful -- an old GLASS COKE BOTTLE. He takes it by the neck, shatters it against a rock, and
We all pitched in.
Take some pictures for us.
","Wait-! Will turns off the walkie-talkie.
Vogue man. It's all perfumed. I put on my 3-D glasses and it's like you're there. Richie ""motor boats"" the air in front of him. ANGLE on a GROUP OF fashionably dressed GIRLS NEARBY. The bigger, heavier one of the group notices someone off screen.
Yeah right, Dorsey Coen's been living in home ec these last three weeks.
Sure they will. In a ditch. All decomposed, covered in worms and maggots and smelling like your
Ma'am.
Eddie-bear? Will elbows him.
The Miss America of cute boys. Seriously.
C'mon Eds get your ass down here and help. EDDIE paces the embankment with their shoes and socks and backpacks. He looks anxious.
What's gray water?
Smells alright to me.
Whatcha got there Willy boy? Will comes sloshing up. He flips Richie the sneaker.
Son of a-- Richie tosses it to Stan who drops it like a hot potato.
How do you think Dorsey feels? Running around these woods with only one friggin' shoe.
Dorsey!
For what?
Shit, Eds you get within twenty feet of a peanut she has a whole herd. I don't want to think what she'll have if you come home with another kid's corpse.
Holy friggin' Moses. What happened to you? BEN COLLAPSES on the river bank. The boys rush to his side.
Heads up, homeschool!
You're not the only one on Bower's shitlist. Ben nods, grateful for the company. He notices in the mural, in one of the windows, a CLOWN watches the ambush with glee.
I don't think she even knows you're alive man.
What do you think? He's handing `em the kid's shoe. It's riveting. Ben checks his Timex, cracked but working.
Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', huh?
You're pretty friggin' hard to miss.
Will won't talk about it but the kid's arm got ripped clean off in a flash flood or something. Richie turns towards Stan, who's been unnaturally quiet this whole time.
Cat got your tongue?
Well?
So let's get outta here. Police stations always make me feel guilty of something.
Barrens? Don't fag out.
But we got a project we're working on out there.
Whoa, what's with the history project, Benny-boy? Richie notices that Ben's walls are covered in xerox copies and historical drawings, all relating to Derry's history.
The entire town? Eddie is freaked out by this revelation.
Shit, maybe we could get Derry on Unsolved Mysteries! Ben points out on an old map that has a translucent modern map drawn by hand laid over it, his tracing coordinates-
It's summer, dorkus. If you're gonna kill time, do it right.
Eddie?
Will you stop with the grey water shit. You make it seem like any water we get in is like swimming in an out-house.
What are you waiting for? Why don't you get in you pussy? Eddie dips the toes of one of his feet in. Flabbergasted, Richie gives up on motivating Eddie. Richie dives under the water and swims beneath the kicking legs of all his friends, a shark's P.O.V. He doesn't see... PENNYWISE floating in from the depths beneath him. On the surface Ben yelps, something yanking his leg. Richie surfaces.
I thought so. Something yanks Richie's leg too. Hard. He and Ben wait for whoever it was to surface from the inky water. Ben sees Will, Bev, and Stan swimming back toward Eddie on the edge of the quarry. They scream and laugh and swim their asses back to land.
Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing vibes with all this chitter chatter. Beverly, eyes still closed, places a cigarette in her mouth and lights up. Ben notices her hands shake as she holds the cigarette in her mouth. The smoke swirls and dissipates over them.
We already know you're crazy, Will. No judgement here.
That wasn't Georgie, that was your neighborhood sex offender making a house call.
I take it back. I'm judging all of you and you are all friggin' wackos. Beverly, still laying there, exhales a long trail of smoke.
Can you give me an indicator of what I'm about to walk into?
I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've just won publishers clearing house 10 million dollar sweepstakes. But if it is, you really didn't have to go through so much trouble, you could have just brought Ed to the quarry. She has no intention of going in. Will pushes past Richie and opens the door.
It's like someone slaughtered a pig in here. Or a parent. Richie is slack jawed.
All I'm saying is maybe there's some weirdo going around Derry dressed as a clown. You know, like the Joker in a ""Dark Knight"" comic. Some whack job who likes to dress up and kidnap kids.
I don't know. Who knows how crazy people do things, right? Pebbles hit the window. Richie goes over, sees Eddie and Stan jumping up and down. The sound of footsteps come up the hallway. They look at each other, who's the extra footsteps?
What happened, homeschool? Mike says nothing, his eyes looking forward in anger. Will and the others rush toward Chief Borton's office.
Benny-boy, don't forget the ranch dressing. The walkie-talkie SQWUAKS back.
(mimicking Paul Hogan) You call that a firecracker? This is a firecracker. He opens his palms, revealing SEVERAL M-80s. The boys collectively `woah' with excitement.
What?
Getting laiiiid.
Cuz blood always freaks a girl out.
I didn't need to know that.
Ironic right? Something that's suppose to make kids laugh, actually being super freaky. He does it Rick James style. Everyone laughs.
Home school. They look where he's running from and see Bowers Gang, in the Trans-Am delayed by foot traffic.
When do you ever think anything is a good idea?
You want to swim?!
If we die here I just want to say that fight was friggin' awesome.
Don't count your chickens.
I'm not going up there. The others ignore him, follow Ben and Mike up the stairs. Richie looks around him at the scary basement, the furnace hulking in the corner like a being with eyes. The water surrounds his shoes. He runs up after his friends.
Whatever it is, we don't want to go back in there.
You gotta a better idea? Glass breaks and CROWS STORM OUT OF A WINDOW behind them. Startled, they all lose their footing and fall, crashing down onto a pile of rope below.
We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis
Well, that went well.
Welcome to the club, kid. They half-heartedly pat Mike on the back.
The point of telling us was? Ben looks at Will.
Whatevs. It sounds like bunk to me. Didn't the guy who wrote this go insane or something?
Okay Schwarzenegger twins, simmer down. We can't even free Eddie from ""mom jail"" let alone take down some freaky shape-shifter with a mind- meld on all the adults of Derry. However, I do believe we could sell this story to ""Tales from the crypt.""
Yeah well, the only time I've been spooked is when I'm with you jokers. I'm thinking I might be safer at home. At least I know my parents won't try to kill me. Richie goes too, leaving just the four.
(through his teeth) Way to make an entry, Eddie-bear.
What do you mean your dad attacked you?
Whoa whoa whoa. You don't really
And friggin do what? In this storm? Water is actively dripping on them.
I hope your schlong grew those 12 inches cuz you're gonna need it.
Happy bar mitzvah, Jason. Bet you didn't put this sucker on your gift list. Someone pounds at the door.
Uh, guys! Scrawled in blood on the stones is a warning:
Something tells me we're not in Derry anymore.
You still afraid of a little grey water?
Mind equals blown right now. The camera flips around and THE WORLD RIGHTS ITSELF, the oculus now above. The pool, which seemed small before, is now enormous -- like a dark, brooding lake -- the crypt island very far from them.
What? Ben suddenly realizes. Bev also feels something on her foot.
The worst and only bar mitzvah party you will ever have. They help Stan to his feet. Mike looks back over his shoulder for the monster.
And that's supposed to rally us, Will?
I'm taking this fucker out.
It's miller ti-- Suddenly the GRAVITY SPELL WEARS OFF and the kids all fall to the ceiling of the stone crypt. Bev almost falls out into space, caught by Ben just in time. The water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool all collapse back toward the floor, along with some of the stones in the crypt around them, which begins to crumble. At first the losers hang on, afraid to fall, but eventually they lose grip and fall toward the oculus, which has begun to fill up with the water from the falls and reflecting pool. They all plunge safely into the new pool below, Will's foot kicking out the bottom of it into outer space before being pulled back by Stan.
Shit!
Now can we celebrate?
I had to mow like five hundred lawns. Stan smoked the clippings.
","So how's it work?
The ceremony. Your Bar Mitzvah.
Marie Claire.
Jesus, she's still here? The RABBI'S WIFE, sleepless and desperate, lurks on the edge of school property, scanning the throngs of departing kids with desperate eyes. Next to her, a FRONT LAWN MARQUEE reads:
They're not going to find him.
Hi Mom.
Yes, ma.
Bye ma. Fast as they came the boys blow out the front door.
No way. There's sixty million diseases in that stream. It's gray water.
Tell `em Will. Your dad works for the public works. Will is studying the sneaker.
Sewer water. Pee and poop. I'm telling you guys you're splashing around in Derry's toilet. Richie and Eddie shrug and continue building their dam.
What's the big deal? It's just a sneaker. Will has to fish it back out of the water.
Shit. This isn't good, guys. This seriously isn't good. We should go.
Guys-- Guys stop. We're gonna get in trouble.
I don't know. Disturbing evidence. Contaminating a scene. We should just mark where we found the shoe and leave an anonymous note to Chief Borton. My mom would have a major cow if she knew I was playing down here, I kid you not.
That's not funny, Richie. That's so not funny. Will, please.
Fine. You guys can do what you want but I'm going. I have no interest in seeing the muddy mangled body of
Woah, that's a lot of money. Will? Will pulls out one crumbled dollar.
You crazy? My mom finds out I bought this stuff for myself I'll have to spend the whole weekend in the emergency room getting x-rayed.
My EpiPen Jr.?
I don't spaz. Those are allergic reactions. Life threatening allergic reactions.
Thanks, Mr. Keene. That one was a real shit kicker.
Shit Stan, what happened to you? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Yeah.
I think he means you, Big Ben. The boys shove him playfully. Ben shoves back.
Guys, you think whoever kidnapped Dorsey might of, I dunno... got Georgie too?
Will's little brother. Or was. Before your time.
What did he say?
Later days.
Hey, isn't that where Will's brother, Georgie- Richie slaps Eddie in the back of the head. His fierce eyes castigating Eddie for not thinking before speaking, Eddie confused, ""wha-?""
Screw that.
Ben, with those cuts you have on your chest, I'm not sure if getting in this water-
Haunted how?
Like. In your dreams?
Oh God. Oh God.
There was a lot of blood. Eddie shakes his head. Something disturbing catches his attention.
Only us kids can see it. Borton narrows his eyes at Richie, the only one silent.
On what?
It makes sense though. If it's killing kids. A clown is the perfect cover.
They're going to cream him.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Really guys, there has to be another option.
I'm serious. This house--
We shouldn't be here!
There's something I didn't tell you guys.
This house. I saw something here once. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, but now I know... They sense what he is about to say isn't going to be good.
I saw ""IT."" Eddie nods.
(whispering in fright) It's here.
Shit. Guys, look. Everyone turns and sees HUNDREDS OF CROWS perched atop the railing of the main staircase and in the rafters above.
Guys? From the hole above, Will and Ben appear.
Get me out of here.
What do you mean you can't get down stairs? Eddie looks around the creepy room at the sheets. Something horrible could be under any one of them.
I- I think I broke my arm. He holds it up and the lower part of his arm hangs irregularly. Behind him the old refrigerator SHAKES,
No. No no no. Will? Help me!
Hurry, guys! The fridge door starts to YAWN OPEN. Eddie curls in a ball and closes his eyes.
This isn't happening. This isn't happening. Inside is Pennywise, all curled up. He unfurls himself like a coiled snake, holding a balloon on a string. It drags him, floating just above the bloody floor, across the room toward Eddie.
Go away!
No.
No. Feels fine I guess.
I'm not allowed to see them.
My Mom thinks they're the reason I got hurt. She says I'm sensitive and they don't take care of me like she does. Dr. Handor wants to say something, but hesitates.
Yeah. Mom says I should always carry my Epi-pen with me, in case I ever have an episode.
Not me, momma... You.
He said I was never allergic until you made me start carrying around my Epi-pen. You put those allergies in my head.
Then why did you send my friends away? She starts to feel the fluttery bird of panic.
You lied to me mamma. You've been giving me medicine that's not really medicine.
This is what's going to happen now. He pulls out his Epi-pen and throws it in the trash. Mrs. Kaspbrak gasps.
I'm going out that door and you won't stop me. I'm going to my friend Stan's bar-mitzvah and when I come home you're never going to tell how weak or sick or delicate I am ever again. THUNDER crackles outside.
Guess I'm not as weak as I thought.
You guys, if ""IT"" can take over Beverly's parents, why not the rest of ours?
What do you mean?
Wait, count you in to what?
Oh my God oh my God!
Dorsey's other shoe. Stan sweeps his flashlight up the wall. What he finds makes Richie spring back.
Hurry. Victor sees them. He's freaked.
Don't get too close to the edge, Will.
You still wear diapers at night? Eddie grabs Richie's hand and they jump into the waterfall together. They are swept up up up into...
It's in our head. All the stuff we see. It's like the allergies my mom said I had. We make it real.
Stanley, snap out of it.
What do you mean?
Because we'll taste better.
Did we kill it? Will isn't sure, he looks at the rest of them.
Well Richie mostly.
","Don't be such a wuss. I'd come if I weren't dying. Now get the paraffin.
You want it to float or not, Georgie? Go on. Storm's not gonna last forever.
Trashmouth. They wave at each other. Richie, bug-eyed glasses, turns the wave into a middle-finger.
I am.
Nothing. Georgie and I are making a paper boat. Got to go-
Okay. Just don't get any on my blankets or Mom'll freak. George dips his finger and spreads it.
There you go. She's all yours.
You're the Captain, ain't ya? Captains call their boats she. Now put on your rain stuff or you'll wind up stuck in bed like your stupid brother. They both grin, the cozy room full of cheerful brotherly love. George kisses Will on the cheek, startling him.
Be careful out there!
Richie!
It makes you officially a man right?
Just your mom's Cosmo.
Maybe she expects her son to just walk out of the school with the rest of us.
You suck, Bowers! Travis and his goons turn. They glare at Will menacingly.
Yeah, Dad. Will looks like he wants to say more, but doesn't have the words to articulate it.
Hi, Ma. Growing accustomed to his parent's lack of communication, he sifts through a PILE OF UNOPENED MAIL on the dining table and finds his report card. Opens it. All A's.
I got my report card. He holds the paper limply in his hands. She doesn't acknowledge him and instead gets up and slides the doors shut to the piano room.
Mrs. Kaspbrak.
Just my backyard, Mrs. K. We got a new, uh, badminton set.
Cutest boy we know, Mrs. Kaspbrak.
It's like where all the wash water and storm drain runoff goes.
Guys! Shut up! They all shut up and turn to Will.
Look inside. Richie does. ""DORSEY COEN"" is written in black marker.
Stan, you idiot.
It's Dorsey Coen's sneaker.
If he's still running.
Dorsey!
I'm with Richie. If I were Dorsey I'd want us to look for me.
Okay Richie, you and...
Ben stay here. We'll get some bandages and stuff. Will and Eddie race in, leaving Ben and Richie in the alley which is emblazoned with a COLORFUL MURAL about the FBI's ambush of the infamous Bradley Gang, a celebrated slice of Derry town history.
All I got. You got an account here don't you?
Well we need to do something. That kid out there looks like someone killed him. They glance at the mirror where MR. KEENE (70s) the grumpy, eagle-eyed pharmacist watches them like a hawk.
Huh?
Eds, shut up. She's on to something.
Oh no. Eddie! Eddie!
I'm a pacifist.
We got it!
Nothing. Thanked me for being a good young citizen.
Fag you later.
I found something today. No response. Finally his Mom stirs.
That missing Coen boy. I found a clue.
What about Arcadia? His dad stops mid flip, all the air going out of the room.
We haven't talked about our park trip at the end of the summer. Usually by now we're all looking at the brochure together. We have so much fun there every-- Will's dad throws the magazine down.
What did I say?
I'll mow lawns. Paint fences. Whatever.
Mine too.
Hello? Dad?
Ma? Will sees a YELLOW FLASH of something ducking around the corner. Startled, Will drops the Lego turtle, which smashes into pieces and scatters across the wood floor...
Georgie? Will moves to step into the water when he hesitates, holding his foot over it. He looks to Georgie whose expression of distress seems insincere.
There's a leak in my ceiling. Then I went to check the cellar and its
You have a copy of the Town Charter. Seriously?
Yeah, it's where Georgie died.
Don't worry about it. Why do you have all this stuff anyway? I mean. What are you going to do with it? Will can't take his eyes off all of the information.
Who's first.
I'll go first.
Do you guys ever feel there's something wrong with Derry. Like it's, I don't know, haunted or something?
I keep thinking about Ben's walls. Ben, happy to have something else to focus on other than Beverly, looks at Will.
Yeah. It's strange. Stan opens his eyes and joins in.
I... If I tell you guys something you won't think I'm crazy.
I saw Georgie last night. Only. It wasn't him.
No. In my house, he tried to get me to go into the basement with him.
Shut up Richie. It wasn't just him. I saw this other... I don't know.
Yes. That's what it was, a scary looking clown. And it had these teeth...
We should leave lookouts. Ben, Stan, can you? Ben is ready to protest. Then succumbs, crestfallen.
What happened? Bev is so relieved she almost cries.
You okay, Eddie? Eddie Kaspbrack? Eddie snaps to it, suddenly more composed, resolute even.
Ed. Go outside. Get Ben and send him in here. Eddie just nods and walks out the door.
You see it, don't you, Richie? Richie nods.
We can't leave it like this. Let's clean it up.
Okay, so how did he put Georgie in my basement?
You okay?
We know what's been taking the kids. Chief! Borton steps out. His long day just got worse.
No, we all saw it.
I guess we're on our own.
Think that could take ""IT"" down?
What we're scared of. It was Georgie's corpse for me cuz, cuz that's what I care about. It was a naked woman for Stan because he's so afraid of-
Back to point. It showered Beverly in blood cuz...
It. It's everything and anything. All our nightmares. All evil, wrapped into one.
They want to get closer. See their tricks. Just then Will sees MIKE running for his life down the street.
Shit. Isn't that-
With these. Will points to their arsenal of fireworks.
Don't move.
Trust us. We're here to help you take these jerks.
(into the walkie-talkie) Not yet... not yet. Now! Between the Trans-Am and Mike and Will, Ben and Richie heave their shoulders into a large steel DUMPSTER filled with construction material. They push it down a driveway that leads to the street. It creaks, starts to wobble, then move down the incline. When it hits street level, though, the gutter stops it from going out into line of the Trans Am.
Oh shit. Abort! Abort!
Run! They're about to dodge the car when-
Real as it gets... Now, Stan and Eddie! Eddie and Stan charge from behind a hedge. Lighting bottle- rockets aimed at the car. Travis and his boys have to duck for cover as ONE of the rockets ZINGS through the car.
I don't wanna stay and find out. Ben and Richie race up from behind, letting loose another barrage as they pass Bowers' gang and the Trans Am, giving cover as the FIRE FIGHT, literally, becomes a retreating manoeuver towards the pier at the end of Neibolt street.
Leave us alone Bowers. I don't want anyone to get seriously hurt.
Okay. Ben, we'll hold him off while we can, you and Stan see if you can find a way in. Covering them, Mike, Richie and Will continue to fire off what fireworks they have left. Bowers' boys light off another barrage of M-80's. Will, armed with a plank bats one back like a baseball. BOOM! It explodes at Victors feet. Ben quickly runs towards the house, followed by Stan and Bev. Eddie, stuck in the middle, goes after them down the pier.
Charge!!! NAILS MOOSE IN THE FOREHEAD, drawing blood. Travis and the others stop dead, incredulous, as rocks pelt them. It turns into a crazy rock fight. Will looks back. He can't see any of his friends who are on the other side of the house.
Go! Go! Go! Mike and Richie slip in, lowering themselves onto a floor littered with crates and boxes. Will last in just as... Travis and his buddies round the house. Moose walks right by the window they slipped into but doesn't seem to see it.
Shhhhush. Richie does a little pistol shoot with his hands to Ben and mouths ""awesome."" Ben smiles.
What?
Something's wrong with Derry. Haunting it. Hunting and killing kids. We've all seen it. Mike looks at them all, judging their earnestness. Feels he can trust them, an instant connection with people whose fear clings to your own.
Stairs. Suddenly they HEAR FOOTSTEPS, above. They look up as dust falls from one side of the roof, slowly making its way to directly over them. To the stairs.
C'mon. Will leads the way upstairs.
Eddie! Will runs around the gaping hole in the floor and tries to run down the stairs when...
Eddie. Realizing he is alone.
We tried, we can't get down stairs.
Do you see anything you could use to climb out?
What do we do?
Ah, fuck! Eddie scurries away from Pennywise, who bares his fangs at Will.
Who know what's going on.
Exactly. No one listened to him like no one listens to us. And unless we do something, ""IT's"" never going to stop.
We can kill it.
I don't think that's a choice, Stan. ""IT"" knows we know. We hurt it. It's going to want to hurt us back.
We're all scared. That's what it feeds off of. I heard the clown tell Eddie as much. Our only defense is to stick together.
Hey. They both startle and look at Will standing there.
Why? To scream at each other more?
And Georgie right? You, dad, and Georgie.
No. You stop. I hate it. Tip toeing around you guys like I don't exist. Like I'm the one who died and the only one who's still here is Ge--
What do you care? At least she heard me.
I miss Georgie, too.
Do you? Because it seems like every adult in this town is blind to what's really happening, blind to what any of us kids are going through. Will shoulders past his father and runs out the door.
C'mon, clown. Show your ugly face! I'll stick another firecracker in it for Georgie. Blow your whole stupid head off. Send you back to wherever a creeper like you comes from. Where are you!? He listens for a response. Nothing. Just the bubbling sound of water rushing through the sewer. Water. Something dawns on Will.
The sewers.
""IT."" Whenever it shows up, there's always water around. The storm drain where Georgie died. The leak in my room. Beverly's sink.
I'll bet if you trace every terrible event in Derry you'll find the same thing. Water. With the Penobscot river on one side and Kenduskeag canal cutting through it's impossible to escape.
Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah. I almost forgot.
You are now. Let's go! A pair of YELLOW EYES glow from the drain.
Bev. You okay?
What? What did he do Beverly? She looks at both of them, tears running down her face, her pretty dress soaked in the rain.
Not someone. ""IT"". Eddie, thinking about his mother.
The sewers. Me and Mike figured it out. That's how it gets around. That's where it lives.
The sewers. We go in. All of us.
Get rid of ""IT"" before ""IT"" gets rid of us, one by one. It doesn't know what to do when all of us are together, you have to believe me.
C'mon! The storm picks up force, wind blowing umbrellas inside out and from the hands of guests trudging back to the parking lot. One goes tumbling across the gardens and into... THE BLACK BOILING RIVER and sinks into the dark water.
We need to protect each other Stan. The seven of us is all we have. Together ""IT"" can't hurt us. I promise.
I have faith. Just like you. Stan looks to the others, everyone scared but ready for battle. Stans steels himself, owning up his chainsaw. The door shakes with Zach behind it.
Don't look back! They dart into the blackness of the huge, rusty pipe. Travis turns back to Victor, a dull craze in his eyes. He gestures to the conveyor the kids climbed down.
There's suppose to be a tunnel here. The last tunnel that's shown on the map. It's a SHOE. Eddie comes over it.
Keep moving! Stan finds a loose stone.
Don't jiggle it too much, whatever you do.
Victor. Will is pointing. Beverly follows his eyes to the knife in Victor's hand, which has PUNCTURED THE MEMBRANE.
It doesn't matter what it calls itself. What matters is it's afraid to show us what it really is. Which means we can beat it. Will sees Beverly over by one of the waterfalls.
Beverly, wait-! She jumps into the waterfall and it sweeps her up up up to the ceiling. Will and the boys swap holy shit looks. Ben jumps in after her, then Will, Mike, and Stan. Richie looks to Eddie, who has the same terrified look as at the quarry. He holds out his hand.
We all here? Richie looks back where they just ""fell"" from.
Guys, the island. Let's swim. They splash toward the crypt island. Ben is the first to feel something brush past his leg. A replay of the quarry.
Hurry! The kids hustle it freestyle across the pool for the island. WE PULL BACK WIDE TO SEE a monstrously big, faintly outlined starfish-like creature with an orange glowing eye, lurking in the depths of the reflecting pool. Will, then Bev, then Richie dodge a tentacle and all get to the island. Stan is not far behind, with Mike, Eddie and Ben taking the rear, swatting back more tentacles. From under Stan the ORANGE EYE APPEARS, the dark water around him suddenly aglow. He looks down into it and it becomes clear the eye is really a mouth, and the orange is coming from deep inside its bowels -- THE DEADLIGHTS. Stan looks directly into them and is mesmerized, so much so that he stops swimming.
Stan what are you doing! Paralyzed, Stan starts to sink toward the deadlights when Mike, shielding his eyes, grabs Stan and swims him back to the surface. All the kids give cover with their weapons -- shooting flares, swinging the sledgehammer, impaling with the stake, using the hubcap as a shield -- so that Mike, helped by Ben and Eddie, can drag Stan onto the island.
Stan, it's us. You in there buddy? Another tentacle squirms out of the water toward them. Ben shoots it with a crossbow. It goes slithering back in.
Maybe. Or just changing into something else.
It's using our fears against us. It wants us to be afraid.
We have to stick together, to help each other against that kind of fear you only have when you're alone. Alright? They all nod and follow Will onto the structure, starry deep space through the oculus visible over their shoulders. They come to a child-sized TRAP DOOR with an ancient, cosmic marking. The only way in or out.
Ready?
My turn. Will takes a breath, drops in...
I'm not afraid of you, clown.
Guys?
Ahhhh! Will drops his bag of flares and scrambles off, tripping over the hole in the floor, leg sloshing in the pool. Glimpses of Pennywise scuffling in the dark like a spider. Will finds a corner, the flare running out of spark. He waves it this way and that, illuminating the dark in front of him. Swinging his baseball bat wildly at shadows.
Come out from the dark then. Come out from behind that stupid mask and show me what you really are. C'mon! Will looks at the last light of his flare, waiting for the end. He looks the bat in his clutch only to see it's morphed into...
I'm sorry, Georgie. Pennywise goes for a bite and...
You're not Georgie.
No! I have to think.
No. Will grabs his stake away. He turns to Georgie. Kneels down. Takes his wet little head in his hands.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go out there with you. I'm sorry I was sick.
Hairspray. Bev sprays it through his lit flare. Torching Georgie.
We've got to get out of here.
We'll get out. C'mon.
No. I don't know--
Swear, guys. Swear if IT isn't dead, if it ever returns, we'll come back and fight it together. They all clasp hands and lock eyes. A BLOOD OATH IS SWORN.
Thanks.
