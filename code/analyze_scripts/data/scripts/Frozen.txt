FROZEN | Written by Adam Green January 28, 2009
EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - DAY                                    1 | Peace. Fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side. It's quiet. So quiet.
HARD CUT TO: | 
FROZEN | 
HARD CUT TO: | 
2   EXT. THE CHAIR LIFT - DAY                                     2 | Tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released. Tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as they kick into motion. Wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses of a threesome of SKIERS. Even wider to reveal a long line of Skiers and SNOWBOARDERS awaiting their moment to step up to the chair. The camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of the line, decked out in their winter gear.
3   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        3 | Angle on DAN WALKER (college age, shaggy hair, holding a snowboard and a helmet in one hand) as he studies the situation. Next to him stands an impatient JOE LYNCH (college age, goggles on his head and a face full of fresh stubble, standing on skis).
LYNCH | I don't see her.
DAN | The shift change is late. Just wait. PARKER O'NEIL (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard) sighs and stares back at the lift lane.
2. | 
PARKER | Are you sure about this?
DAN | We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it.Lynch smiles at Parker.
LYNCH | I'm cute.Just then, JASON (a ski mountain employee) approaches thefront of the line and excuses the employee working the chair.
PARKER | Is um... is that her?
DAN | Shit.
LYNCH | Dude.
DAN | It's cool, it's cool. (to Parker) Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him-
PARKER | -What? Me? No way. This is your thing.
DAN | Parker, listen, listen. It's so easy. All you do is tell the guy that you and your friends-
LYNCH | -GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".
DAN | -you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets.He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it inParker's hand.
3. | DAN (cont'd) Start at $50. That's what we usually give the other lady. He'll take it. Trust me.
PARKER | Dan, no. You do it. I feel stupid.
DAN | You've got this. You can totally do this.
LYNCH | Parker, you've so got this.
DAN | The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no.
PARKER | Why me?
LYNCH | `Cause you're a girl.
DAN | A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. (then) Just... He unzips her jacket a little bit, showing some more of her body. DAN (cont'd) There.
PARKER | My charming smile? Dan and Lynch smile back at her. She exits reluctantly towards the lift line.
4   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                                4 | Parker pushes her snowboard forward and moves up the side of the line, passing all of the skiers who are waiting. She approaches Jason who is now running the lift. He lights a cigarette.
4. | 
PARKER | Hey.Jason looks up at her. PARKER (cont'd) Could I bum a smoke?She flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quicklyobliges with a cigarette. PARKER (cont'd) Thanks.He lights her cigarette. PARKER (cont'd) I'm Parker.He looks around, not all that sure why a cute girl is talkingto him for more than just to get a smoke.
JASON | Jason.
PARKER | Oh, cool. My brother's name is Jason.
PARKER | Yeah, so I don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid...Jason is all ears. PARKER (cont'd) My girlfriends and I drove all the way up here from Salem State, and I was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that I could cover the lift tickets on my Mom's credit card...but then I left her credit card at the gas station...and so...Jason totally sees where this is going.
5. | 
JASON | Right.
PARKER | No- but I mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know? Jason exhales two lungs full of smoke as the next group gets onto the lift.
JASON | How much?
PARKER | Like...fifty? Jason scoffs and starts the lift.
JASON | I could lose my job. He looks around.
5   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        5 | Lynch and Dan watch Parker at work.
LYNCH | He's not going for it.
DAN | Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it?
LYNCH | Minimum.
DAN | -Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more. Lynch sighs, then changes the subject.
LYNCH | She had to come skiing with us? Dan looks back at him, offended.
6. | 
DAN | You said you didn't mind?
LYNCH | I don't. I don't mind. Don't mind at all.
X | A beat. LYNCH (cont'd) I'm just saying, you haven't done dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with
R | us since last semester. You never come around for Monday night football, nobody has seen you at-
DAN | 
A | -I watched the game with you last week!
LYNCH | For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes.
M | They're lots of ten minutes-es, you know?
DAN | Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you...
LYNCH | It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything.They see Parker hand Jason something. He pockets it and sheglides her way back to the end of the line.She looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and thenexcitedly waves. Proud of herself.
7. | Dan smiles at Lynch.
6   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                             6 | Lynch and Dan join Parker and slowly work their way up the line.
LYNCH | You did great.
PARKER | There isn't any.
PARKER | He wasn't going for it at 50.
DAN | 
D | So what happened to the other fifty numbers in between there? Like, I don't know, $51 or maybe even $75?
PARKER | 
E | You gave me two 50's. What was I supposed to do, ask for change?
LYNCH | I would have asked for change.
PARKER | It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right? Dan is disappointed.
LYNCH | I would have definitely asked him for change.
8. | They get up to the front of the line. Jason looks at Dan and Lynch behind Parker.
JASON | (scoffs at Parker) "Girlfriends"?
X | Parker gives him an apologetic smile. The three get in front of the chair. It descends under them and scoops them off of the ground into the air.
DAN | I'm just not a `pet name' guy.
PARKER | Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like "honey" or "sweetie".
LYNCH | I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here. Dan looks back to Parker.
9. | 
DAN | See? At least I don't call you "O'Neil".
PARKER | You don't touch my face enough either.
X | Dan laughs.
LYNCH | (to no one imparticular)
R | Third wheel.Parker reaches across and playfully taps Lynch.
PARKER | 
A | Watch it, Lynch.
LYNCH | Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck.
M | Parker shoots Dan a look: "Oh, really?"
DAN | Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck. (then, forced) Sweetie.
D | After a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face.Nothing sweet or sensitive about it, but he's trying.
PARKER | 
E | (sarcastically) Aww!
LYNCH | (to Parker) Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?
PARKER | I wouldn't say that. But last time we went I did pretty good, right?
DAN | You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike.
LYNCH | Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.
LYNCH | 
E | Have you ever sniffed your floss? It's nasty.Dan and Lynch both crack up at this, huge.
DAN | No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my floss? Why am I friends with you?Parker blows more smoke out. DAN (cont'd) Gimme a drag.He takes her cigarette from her.
11. | 
PARKER | What time do you think we'll get back? I have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.
LYNCH | Oh no. She broke the rule.
X | (to Parker) Parker you just broke the first rule.
PARKER | 
R | What?
DAN | No worrying about the bullshit of real life. The whole point of this
A | is to relax and have fun. Worry about school when you get home.
PARKER | But, I haven't read a-
M | The chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly. Thesound of the chair lift cuts out.A deep silence takes over quickly, like the type of silencethat used to suddenly happen in school when you were taking atest and the radiator that you never even noticed was onwould suddenly shut off.
D | Random SKIERS and BOARDERS in the surrounding chairs expresstheir disgust for the delay.Parker instinctively grabs Dan's hand.
LYNCH | Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights?
PARKER | No.
LYNCH | So it doesn't bother you when I do this?Lynch rocks the chair back and forth.Parker grabs hold of the safety bar.
12. | 
PARKER | Quit it!Dan motions to Lynch to stop. PARKER (cont'd) I'm not afraid of heights. I just
X | don't like them.
DAN | Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off
R | of a lift.
PARKER | Points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up.
PARKER | 
M | (nervous laughter) Oh, shut-up.Lynch turns around and yells behind him.
THE CHAIR RIGHT? | 
D | Laughter echoes from the chairs behind him.He yells forward.
E | LYNCH (cont'd)
DAN | Actually, I paid good money.
LYNCH | Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing.With a lurch, the chair starts moving forward again and thewhirring sound of the cables above them start up again.Applause is heard from all of the other chairs.
13. | LYNCH (cont'd)
X | He playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as their chair moves forward exiting frame.
8   EXT. TOP OF THE CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                8 | 
R | The three begin to get situated with their boards and skis.
PARKER | Why do I have to wear a helmet?
PARKER | But you guys don't wear them.
M | She looks around. PARKER (cont'd) I only see little kids wearing them.
DAN | 
D | Cause they're still learning, too. Come on, I'm not gonna argue about this.
LYNCH | 
E | Even extreme boarders wear helmets. Nobody makes fun of them. She begrudgingly puts on her helmet. She's not happy about it. Dan and Lynch smile.
DAN / LYNCH | Awww.
PARKER | You're just doing this to make fun of me. Dan's laughing.
14. | 
DAN | No, I'm not. I swear. You look hot in a helmet.Off to the side, Lynch spots SHANNON (cute, brunette, 20's)struggling with her boot strap. She falls down on her ass.
X | Lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side.
LYNCH | Need some help?
A | directly into his face.Parker and Dan watch from afar as Lynch helps her with herboot strap.He has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he is
M | fastening the strap with his other.
PARKER | Aww, check out Lynch.From their point of view, they watch Lynch helping the girl.
DAN | 
D | See? Chick magnet.Almost as if on cue, RYAN (an enormous dude, 20's) stompsover and shoves Lynch down into the snow.
LYNCH | Woah! Shit, man! I was just trying to help!Instantly, Dan moves over to Lynch's aid. Parker followsslowly behind him. She's clearly not too good on her board.
SHANNON | Ryan, what the hell?
RYAN | He had his hands all over you!
15. | 
SHANNON | No he didn't. I can take care of myself!She shoves him back. Ryan just shakes his head at her andshoves off, away from the group. He waits for her down thehill a few feet.
X | Dan and Shannon help Lynch to his feet. SHANNON (cont'd) I am so sorry about that. He can
R | be such an asshole sometimes.
LYNCH | I was seriously just trying to help. I mean, how could I even
A | compete with a catch like that?He waves to Ryan. Ryan just looks away.
SHANNON | (laughs)
M | Are you OK?
LYNCH | Yeah, I'm fine.
SHANNON | Well, thank you for your help. I am so, so sorry about that.
D | (then) I'm Shannon, by the way.
LYNCH | Joe.
SHANNON | Well it was nice to meet you.She takes off after Ryan.
LYNCH | (to his friends) I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.
16. | 
DAN | I know you were, man. Come on. Don't sweat it.
LYNCH | Seriously, that guy was such a dick.
R | Lynch starts down the hill.
DAN | I'm tough.
D | Finally, Parker comes to a stop on her own next to Dan and he claps for her.
DAN | 
E | Look at you! See? Having fun?
PARKER | Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too. Lynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them down with powder.
LYNCH | Last one to the bottom is buying dinner! He eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass.
17. | Parker and Dan take off laughing while Lynch feebly tries to get back on his feet.
10   INT. SKI LODGE - EARLY EVENING                            10 | Parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance while
X | Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in front of them.
DAN | We gotta take a weekend trip up
R | North one of these days. Hit up Killington or Okemo and really do it up right.
LYNCH | 
A | Why don't we just do it over Christmas. You and me.
DAN | Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like
M | the stuff you see in commercials. We had to take like 3 lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could see.
LYNCH | Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill
D | all day but do you think we could get one real run in before we leave tonight? Dan feels bad.
LYNCH | No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point.
18. | Parker feels horrible.
PARKER | You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go-
X | Now Lynch feels horrible.
LYNCH | -no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that.
R | Parker looks to Dan.
PARKER | I told you I didn't have to come.
LYNCH | Exactly. Remember? I was like "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come
D | with us?" And you were like-
DAN | -I was like, "OK that would be cool".
E | Parker isn't buying it. She puts on a smile.
PARKER | It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway. (to Dan) Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages.
19. | 
DAN | No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell.
X | Parker laughs.
PARKER | She does not.
R | Dan looks to Lynch.
DAN | Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom
A | kept calling and calling. (to Parker) And what did she want?Parker laughs.
M | DAN (cont'd) She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner. Christmas dinner! Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer.
DAN | 
E | Hell yes, I said chicken, but that's not the point. (to Parker) The point is you can go a few more hours without hearing from Annette.Parker looks to Lynch.
PARKER | I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for you today.
20. | 
LYNCH | You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, "Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing..."
X | Parker and Dan are beaming at him. He knows he's beat. LYNCH (cont'd) (frustrated) What?
A | From their POV the chair lift is still moving but the line is empty. They start to move to the empty lift line when...
LYNCH | (to his friends) Wait up. Lynch walks over to Shannon while Dan and Parker move towards
D | the lift line.
SHANNON | Hey. I just wanted to apologize again.
SHANNON | Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend. We're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work.
LYNCH | (teasing) No way.
21. | 
SHANNON | A group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever. It's a whole story and-She looks over at Dan and Parker.
X | SHANNON (cont'd) -I don't want to hold you up. But that was just really embarrassing. So I just wanted to say sorry. (then)
R | Are you gonna be here next weekend?
LYNCH | Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes.
LYNCH | 
M | That would be...a nice time.
SHANNON | OK. See ya later.She turns and starts walking away.Lynch walks away. He gets a few steps and then turns back
D | and jogs after Shannon again.
LYNCH | Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or
E | something? That way I'll...know how to catch up with you and stuff.
SHANNON | Yeah, sure.Lynch pats his pockets.
LYNCH | Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen?She laughs and shakes her head no.
SHANNON | Don't ski with a pen. Sorry.
22. | 
LYNCH | Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good. Shannon gets serious.
R | SHANNON (cont'd) Kidding.
LYNCH | Whew. You! That's so like you!
M | He puts a red flag on the back of a chair that heads up the mountain.
DAN | But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs!
DAN | 
E | You're only open three days a week. You can't afford to close early.
JASON | Why don't you write a letter? Lynch pushes himself up behind them.
LYNCH | (to Dan) Remember "429".
DAN | What?
23. | 
LYNCH | Just remember "429". (to himself)
"5022". "5022." "5022." | 
PARKER | (to Jason)
X | Come on, just one more run.
JASON | Sorry.
PARKER | What if we promise to run straight
D | down. Like the quickest run ever.
DAN | Wicked fast.
E | Jason struggles. He sighs and looks around. There are stillplenty of skiers coming down.
JASON | Fine. But hurry.
DAN                              PARKER | Thank you! Thank you so much!
DAN | We'll be wicked fast. Like the wind!Jason sends them up the lift. He checks to make sure no oneis watching.
24. | 
13   EXT. CHAIR LIFT    - MOMENTS LATER                        13 | Parker, Dan, and Lynch slowly move up the mountain yet again.
LYNCH | Seriously. For a hundred bucks
X | you'd think he could cut us some slack.
DAN | I know right? They're supposed to
R | stay open until 10 on Sundays. Whatever happened to night skiing?
LYNCH | Wachusett still has night skiing.
A | We should have gone there. It's kinda like Ward Hill but not as lame. (then) Hey, you remember the numbers I told you?
"429". | 
PARKER | Good for you, Lynch. You got her number!
LYNCH | 
E | That guy? Who cares? Steroids shrink your dick. (then) Wait, shit. What were my four numbers? "5022". Parker, will you remember "5022"?
PARKER | Nope.
14   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                         14 | Jason reaches for his cigarettes. He's all out. Disappointed he tosses the empty pack in the trash.
25. | A fellow employee (RIFKIN) approaches.
RIFKIN | Early night, huh?
JASON | You're not gonna hear me complain.
A | JASON (cont'd) Oh, come on. It's my brother's bachelor party. I put in for it two months ago.
JASON | I'm the best man! (under his breath) Shit.
D | Rifkin takes his place.
RIFKIN | Ready to shut down?
E | As Jason runs away he turns back.
JASON | There's three more on their way down. Wait for them, then it's all set.
15   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                              15 | The three continue to talk.
PARKER | I'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat. I'm starving.
26. | 
DAN | Why didn't you have some pizza?
PARKER | You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate? That wasn't pizza. That was like,
X | `roller skating rink birthday party pizza'.
LYNCH | There's a Papa Gino's on our way
R | back. It's like 15 minutes down the road from the mountain.
PARKER | Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real
A | pizza myself.Dan spies something.
DAN | Check it out!
M | They look down to see THREE SKIERS hit a huge jump, one afterthe other. DAN (cont'd) We are so hitting that jump.
LYNCH | 
D | Last run. Gotta make it count.The wind blows the chair really hard.Parker holds on.
DAN | It's just wind, Parker.
LYNCH | Don't you mean, "baby"?Parker starts laughing.
DAN | (to Lynch) Who invited you?
27. | 
16   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - MOMENTS LATER                           16 | Rifkin warms his hands with his breath. The temperature is dropping fast. He checks his watch, dancing back and forth.
X | HEYMAN (another employee) runs by him on his way to the lodge.
RIFKIN | 
R | Heyman! HEY, HEYMAN! Do me a solid? Heyman looks back him. His face already says "no."
A | RIFKIN (cont'd) I've gotta piss so bad I can taste it. Can you just take over for 2 minutes? Heyman points to his ears as if he can't hear what Rifkin is
M | saying to him. He keeps running. RIFKIN (cont'd) Asshole.
17   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                   17 | 
D | A low, distant thunder roll echoes far away.
PARKER | Shit. Do you hear that?
PARKER | Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza. (a few beats) I'm not even kidding.
28. | 
18   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - MOMENTS LATER                      18 | Rifkin kicks his feet around. He spies Jason's discarded cigarette box on the top of the trash and he inspects it for any left over cigarettes.
X | Nothing. He sighs. Just then, the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few
R | minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him. A voice from the top lift cuts through the radio.
VOICE (O.S.) | 
A | Last chair is through. Rifkin picks up the radio and calls the top of the mountain.
RIFKIN | Cool. Last three just hit. I'm
M | clear.
VOICE (O.C.) | Clear up here. He hangs up and moves over to the lever. Tight on the lever as he pulls it back towards him.
E | white noise of the motorized cables goes away, leaving them in silence. The wind blows hard against them.
DAN | Oh, come on. Parker instinctively grabs his hand. The cold bites through their layers of clothing.
PARKER | Bur!
29. | 
LYNCH | (yelling to the sky)
DAN | (quickly)
R | Yes. (then) Anyone got any jokes?
LYNCH | 
A | What did the fourteen year old girl from New Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity?
DAN | "Get off me, you're crushing my
M | Marlboros". Beat.
LYNCH | I told you that?
CUT TO: | 
E | light of converging white strings. Even in this darkness, the menacing clouds are visible over the trees.
CUT TO: | 
21   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 21 | The three sit in the freezing chair. Lynch is really getting impatient.
DAN | What do you think the worst way to die would be?
30. | 
PARKER | That's not morbid.
LYNCH | Yeah, seriously. That's kinda spooky, Dan.
R | surfers where they get hit from behind and they don't even know what happened. (beat) You know. Cause it like came up
A | from beneath them. (beat) Like on the Jaws poster.
LYNCH | The chick on the Jaws poster was
M | hot.
PARKER | She was?
LYNCH | I don't know. She was naked. Naked chicks are hot.
E | getting eaten. Knowing that this animal is coming for you but you can't get away. And that it's going to eat you. Like you're gonna get eaten alive? Have you guys ever seen that footage of the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal?
LYNCH | That's why I only swim in pools.
PARKER | I think burning to death would be the worst.
31. | 
LYNCH | Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.
PARKER | I remember watching TV for like 3
X | days straight after 9/11. That footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the Trade Center? Can you imagine how bad it was inside
R | to know that jumping was a better way out?
LYNCH | But they say that when you jump
A | from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you don't even feel it.
PARKER | OK, then Lynch. What is the worst
M | way to die?
LYNCH | (defensive) What?
PARKER | No, you have an answer for
D | everything. What's your biggest fear?Lynch has been waiting for this.
PARKER | The what?
LYNCH | The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever.
DAN | (teasing) "I don't know why I never have a girlfriend, you guys!"
32. | 
LYNCH | Shut-up. The wind starts blowing again and Parker nestles close to Dan.
PARKER | 
X | Why hasn't it started again?
DAN | Give it a minute.
A | twisted her leg. It was like- "move her to the side and keep the line going people". But no. They had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to-
M | BOOM. The lights go out.
A21   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - CONTINUOUS                           A21 | Across the mountain all of the trail lights go out, one by one.
E | At first no one can speak. Dan reacts first.
DAN | (yelling)
WHAT THE FUCK??!    HELLO???!!!! | 
LYNCH | Come on now! This is messed up.
HELLO!!!! | Dan tries to laugh in frustration.
33. | 
DAN | Are they fucking kidding?
LYNCH | I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie.
HE-LLO!!!!!!!!!!!???? | Parker is starting to shake.
M | He starts waving around his hands. DAN (cont'd)
PARKER | What if they don't start it again?
D | What if everyone went home?
DAN | (angered out of panic) Will you stop?!
E | (recovering) They didn't go home. Stop freaking me out. (then) Remind me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down. This is horse shit.
LYNCH | What did you say to the guy?
DAN | Me? Nothing!
LYNCH | Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this.
34. | 
DAN | I didn't do anything! He knows we're still up here.
PARKER | Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut
X | off the lights and scare the customers?
DAN | They just lost power or something.
R | I'm sure it's gonna come back on any second. (then) They didn't go home. That's retarded.
A | After a few more moments.
LYNCH | This is so messed up.
PARKER | 
D | We need to get down from here. We can't just sit up here. Why isn't the goddamn chair moving, Dan? What the hell?!
PARKER | Don't yell at me.
DAN | I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night?
35. | 
LYNCH | Free lift tickets.
PARKER | What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us.
X | She made a good point. But still...
DAN | We won't be stuck here all night.
A | open again until Friday. (sobbing) We'll be stuck here all week.Silence as Dan and Lynch take this in.
M | PARKER (cont'd) We're gonna die up here.Lynch tries to be the voice of reason.
LYNCH | We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even
D | if by some strange reason they really did forget us up here- we can jump. I see people jump off of chair lifts all the time.
PARKER | (hysterical)
36. | 
DAN | Shh. I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this.
X | More moments pass in silence as they survey their situation.Finally...
PARKER | 
R | I have to pee.They all share an uncomfortable laugh. PARKER (cont'd)
A | I have to pee wicked bad.
LYNCH | That makes two of us.
PARKER | 
M | Ew, Lynch if you pull out your junk in front of me I'm gonna puke.
LYNCH | Well, what do you want me to do? I gotta go.
PARKER | 
D | How am I supposed to go?Dan moves the safety bar a little.
DAN | 
E | Well if we just lift the bar up you could probably just bend over if we hold on to you.Parker instantly starts freaking out with the bar up.
PARKER | Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!!
LYNCH | It's just the safety bar. It doesn't really do anything anyway.
PARKER | Well I like the safety bar and I like it down where it's supposed to be.
37. | 
DAN | Then how are you going to piss?
PARKER | I can hold it.
LYNCH | 
X | For a whole week?Dan and Parker glare at him. LYNCH (cont'd)
R | Sorry. (then) She's the one who said we'd be here for "a week"!
A | Parker takes a deep breath.
PARKER | I can hold it.
DAN | 
M | I'm telling you, five minutes from now we'll all be laughing.
LYNCH | I'm pissing.Lynch lifts the safety bar up, whips out his business andstarts to pee off the side of the chair into the snow below
D | them.
DAN | I hope they catch you and throw you out. I hope they ban you from the
E | mountain. That's so nasty.
LYNCH | Ban me from the mountain? You couldn't pay me to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming back.Lynch finishes his business. LYNCH (cont'd) There. Much better.A low thunder clap rolls in across the trees and the chillingwind picks up.
38. | 
X | Almost instantly, giant balls of hail stream down at them. "Ping-ing" off of the metal chair and pelting their faces. The wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and forth in the foul weather.
R | Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder.
DAN | (quietly) Put the safety bar down, Joe.
SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US! | 
DAN | (louder) Put the bar down.
LYNCH | 
E | Lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away from Dan. The hail/sleet mixture keeps pelting against their skin as they sit together in silence. Another loud thunder clap hits. This time, much closer.
CUT TO: | 
22   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - MOMENTS LATER                          22 | The sleet begins to ice over the leaves and vegetation below. Ski tracks fill in with the wet rain.
23   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - MOMENTS LATER, WIDER                  23 | The entire mountain is covered in dark clouds.
CUT TO: | 
R | Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at them. Dan's head snaps up.
25   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - CONTINUOUS                            25 | A Snow Cat slowly makes it's way down the hill towards the
M | bottom. It's headlights shine across the trees in front of it.
CUT TO: | 
26   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 26 | 
D | Dan begins to cheer.
DAN | What did I tell you guys, huh? WOO-
HOO! UP HERE! | 
CUT TO: | 
27   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - CONTINUOUS                            27 | The Snow Cat is now really close. It is literally coming right for them.
28   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 28 | Dan and Parker wave their hands in the rain.
HELLO! | 
CUT TO: | 
A | look like it's going to stop.
CUT TO: | 
30   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 30 | 
M | Panic sets in yet again.
PARKER | Why isn't he stopping?
31   INT. SNOW CAT - CONTINUOUS                                   31 | 
E | STEVE (the driver) concentrates on the path. The roar of his engine is almost deafening. His radio chimes in.
VOICE (O.C.) | Steve. Steve picks up his radio.
STEVE | Go for Steve.
41. | 
VOICE (O.S.) | We got a problem here.
CUT TO: | 
32   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                32 | 
X | Below them, the Snow Cat slows down to a halt. The three kids cheer.
THANK YOU! / WOO! / YES!! | 
CUT TO: | 
VOICE (O.C.) | 
M | It's nothing but ice at the bottom of Wildcat so you're gonna have to cut over to the south hill and come around the side.
STEVE | That's gonna take me 20 minutes!
STEVE | 
CUT TO: | 
34   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                34 | Below them, they see the Snow Cat start to back up and turn to the right.
LYNCH | What is this asshole doing? The Snow Cat switches back into drive.
42. | 
PARKER | No! No! Quickly Dan and Lynch start to ball together the slush on the sides of the chair. They throw them at the Snow Cat, but keep missing by a few
X | inches. Desperately, Lynch throws his goggles at the Snow Cat. They land just shy of the driver's side window.
R | Parker takes off her helmet and throws it down.
CUT TO: | 
M | Though we can briefly see the light shine off of the three kids, unless you knew they were there or were looking for them...you would have missed them, too. As the windshield turns the other way, one of Lynch's skis slams into the ground, just out of the headlight's view.
CUT TO: | 
E | Lynch throws one of his ski poles but doesn't even come close. Parker sobs hysterically.
HARD CUT TO: | 
37   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - LATER                                 37 | It has stopped hailing.
43. | The moon shines down on the mountain. It glistens like a block of ice. Silence.
CUT TO: | 
R | Finally.
PARKER | My face is burning.
PARKER | No it isn't.
D | don't wear a watch.
LYNCH | Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the
E | locker real quick and I'll find out. No one laughs at his attempt at "humor". LYNCH (cont'd) OK, top 3 breakfast cereals of all time. Go. Silence. LYNCH (cont'd) I'll go first.
PARKER | Stop.
44. | 
LYNCH | Crunch Berries...
PARKER | Please, stop.
LYNCH | 
X | Apple Jacks...
DAN | Dude, quit it.
A | Silence. LYNCH (cont'd) There's just something weird about eating purple horseshoes, am I right?
M | Silence.
PARKER | Everyone went home. They left us up here.More silence.
45. | Finally, Dan puts an arm around her. DAN (cont'd) Shhh. It's OK.
X | His voice is getting hoarse.
PARKER | (aside to Dan)
R | I don't want to die up here.
DAN | (aside to Parker) You're not gonna die, baby. I
A | won't let you die. OK? I promise I won't let you die.Parker cries.
PARKER | 
M | (aside to Dan) I'm so scared.
DAN | (aside to Parker) It's alright. It's alright.Snow starts to lightly fall around them.
D | DAN (cont'd) Hey. It's snowing.They shiver together.
PARKER | Shayna. My puppy.
DAN | Disneyworld in 8th grade.
46. | 
LYNCH | Hmm...guess that leaves me. I'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh?Silence.
X | Parker takes off her glove to light a cigarette.As she struggles with the lighter, the glove falls out of herlap and lands on the ground below them.
LYNCH | 
A | See? That's where smoking gets you.
PARKER | Shut-up.
M | She keeps struggling with the lighter but eventually givesup. She throws the cigarette away and puts her exposed handback in her pocket.The snow falls around them.Dan pushes the safety bar up.
D | PARKER (cont'd) -what, what are you doing?
DAN | I'm jumping. I'm gonna get help.
PARKER | No. No, don't leave me up here.Dan takes her face in his hands. Tenderly. And probably forthe first time...correctly.
DAN | Parker, I can do this. Even if I get hurt, as long as I can get to the bottom I....your skin is so red. You're getting frost bite.
47. | 
LYNCH | You can't get frost bite that fast. It's only been- what, like...how long has it been? A few hours, tops?Dan inspects Parker's face. It's tough to see in the dark,
PARKER | (quietly)
R | Don't leave me.
DAN | I'll get help. Lynch is here. He'll be with you.
A | Lynch is looking down below them. It's far.
LYNCH | Dan, it's a far drop. I don't know.
LYNCH | 
D | If we can wait `til morning I bet someone will come up here. Like a snow groomer or some shit.
DAN | 
E | Really? And why would they come groom the snow on a day when they aren't open, Joe? A day when they still have a full work week before they open again?Lynch says nothing. DAN (cont'd) I can do this.He positions himself to try and jump off. Parker grabs hisarm.
PARKER | No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt.
48. | 
LYNCH | How are you going to find your way in the dark?
DAN | I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom.
X | (then) You don't get a fresher run than this, right?Dan drops his snowboard down.
R | It lands sticking up straight in the snow. DAN (cont'd)
OK. | 
A | Parker and Lynch look back at him. They don't know what tosay.Lynch tries to grab on to Dan's arm.
DAN | One.
D | Parker's tears are freezing on her cheeks as the seconds tickby. DAN (cont'd) ...Two.
E | Lynch takes a deep breath. When enough time has elapsed tothink Dan's gonna jump, he suddenly looks up at Lynch insteadof jumping. DAN (cont'd) Remember when I was saying how I jumped off one of these things before?Lynch stares back at him. DAN (cont'd) I totally lied. I'm scared shitless right now.Lynch musters a laugh. It's forced, but it's a laugh.
49. | Dan laughs back at him. He turns to face Parker. She tries to smile but is frozen with fear. Dan whispers to her... DAN (cont'd) (whispered)
X | You're gonna be OK, baby. ...and he is gone. From his point of view (the camera pointed down at his feet)
R | we drop (without cutting) from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below.
CUT TO: | 
AHHH!!     OH MY GOD!   AHHHH!!!! | 
CUT TO: | 
40   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                  40 | 
D | Parker calls down to him.
PARKER | DAN! DANNY? Oh my god!
E | Dan's cries turn to quiet breaths below them. It is tough for Parker and Lynch to make out what exactly is happening.
LYNCH | Dan, say something. Are you alright? More quiet breaths from below. Finally...
DAN (O.C.) | My legs. I broke my fucking legs.
LYNCH | Oh, shit.
50. | 
PARKER | Can you move? Dan? (she starts to panic) Hold on. Hold on, baby. Lynch stops her.
PARKER | I gotta...I have to get to him.
CUT TO: | 
DAN | Stay there. Don't get off the
D | chair.
PARKER (O.C.) | How bad is it?
E | Dan can see that his legs are shattered and that he is bleeding. Bone protrudes from his bloody ski pants.
DAN | It's bad. It's really fucking bad. (starting to cry)
SOMEONE HELP US! PLEASE! | 
CUT TO: | 
42   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - CONTINUOUS                           42 | Dan's screams can barely be heard from this distance. The blanket of snow muffles all sounds of life on the mountain.
43   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                43 | Parker sobs into Lynch's shoulder.
LYNCH | OK. Alright. You gotta stay
X | strong for me, Parker. Can you do that? He looks every which way, trying to come up with a solution.
R | LYNCH (cont'd) If we go to pieces we're never gonna get through this, OK?
PARKER | 
A | What are we gonna do? We're gonna die up here.
LYNCH | (to Dan below) Buddy, can you move at all?
45   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                45 | 
CUT TO: | 
SLIDE DOWN THE FUCKING MOUNTAIN! | 
LYNCH (O.C.) | Alright, alright. Um...?
52. | 
DAN | ...so much blood.
CUT TO: | 
47   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                     47 | 
PARKER | Here...
A | She takes off her scarf and tosses it below. It blows away into the trees. It doesn't even make it halfway.
M | PARKER (cont'd)
SHIT! | Lynch removes his scarf and balls it up.
LYNCH | Here you go, Dan. I'm throwing mine down.
LYNCH | 
E | Just feel for it, OK? Here it comes... He drops the balled up scarf.
CUT TO: | 
48   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                                48 | The scarf lands right next to Dan.
DAN | What do I do with this?
53. | 
LYNCH (O.C.) | Tie it over your leg. Tie it off above wherever it's bleeding. Like a tourniquet thing. Dan fumbles with the scarf and ties it just above his right knee as tight as he can.
CUT TO: | 
DAN (O.C.) | No! Don't you take off your coat!
M | You need it!
PARKER | No, I'll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch. Please-
CUT TO: | 
DAN | -Parker, keep your coat on.
E | Dan takes off his snowboarding gloves and ties the elastic strings together. His fingers are so numb that it takes several tries. Once tied, he tries to stretch the gloves around his left knee, but it is useless. DAN (cont'd) Shit!
LYNCH (O.C.) | Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding.
54. | 
DAN | I...I've got it.
PARKER | Are you sure. Dan's left leg is definitely still bleeding.
R | Moments pass with only their breathing.
LYNCH (O.C.) | Are you sure you can't try and get
A | down the hill, buddy? Dan falls onto his back, panting from the pain. He struggles to flip himself over, but it hurts too much.
DAN | 
M | No, man. I can't move. I can't move.
CUT TO: | 
51   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 51 | 
D | Lynch holds his head.
LYNCH | Alright. Hold on.
E | Once again, Lynch starts looking all around. Above, below. LYNCH (cont'd) Maybe...if I could climb up to the lift cable? Maybe I could like, scale across to the other chairs until I find one that isn't quite so high up from the ground?
PARKER | You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs? Lynch looks back at her.
LYNCH | I can't even do a pull-up.
55. | 
DAN (O.C.) | You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole. You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy.
DAN (O.C.) | 
R | You can too. Remember Jenny Bluth? She fucking did it. You can do it.
LYNCH | Even if I made it across to the
A | next chair...how many more would it take before I found one closer to the ground?
DAN (O.C.) | Every lift pole has an emergency
M | ladder on it.They look forwards and backwards.The chair behind them is not near the pole.But the one behind that one is.
LYNCH | Shit, that's far.He and Parker just stare at it. LYNCH (cont'd) Just. Just give me a second.He starts taking deep breaths. Trying to psyche himself up.
PARKER | What if you fall, too?
56. | 
LYNCH | Parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death.
PARKER | Maybe...maybe in the morning someone else will come up here.
X | Maybe, they'll need to do maintenance on the lift or something, you know?
DAN (O.C.) | 
R | What's going on up there? You guys?
PARKER | We're right here, baby.
M | maybe I can jump to it.
CUT TO: | 
52   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                           52 | Dan is in agony.
CUT TO: | 
PARKER | Just hang in there, Dan. It's gonna be OK. Lynch starts to maneuver himself in the chair. Slowly he pushes himself up so that he is sitting on the chair back and holding onto the connecting post. The chair swings back and forth in the wind. Above him it is a solid 5 feet before the chair arm connects to the wire.
57. | 
LYNCH | It's funny. But I was never afraid of heights, until like...right now.
PARKER | What can I do to help?
R | Parker maneuvers herself to hold Joe's legs..Joe tries to move into a standing position, but panics.
A | LYNCH (cont'd) OK...OK...just give me a second.
PARKER | I think we should wait til morning. We can make it a few more hours.
D | As Lynch gets ready to try and stand again...we hearsomething in the surrounds.They freeze.
E | Again, a sort of "moan" rings in the distance.
PARKER | Baby, is that you?
DAN (O.C.) | What?
LYNCH | Shh!They listen again.
54   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                           54 | This time, clear as day...a WOLF HOWL.
DAN | Oh, motherfucker.
55   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                55 | 
R | Lynch tries to control the panic.
LYNCH | It's alright man. It's just a
A | coyote or something. They're scared of people. It probably won't even come anywhere near us,
OK? | 
DAN (O.C.) | 
M | That sounded like a fucking wolf.
LYNCH | Just relax. When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England?
CUT TO: | 
E | is becoming.
DAN | I read about one on-line somewhere last year. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
CUT TO: | 
59. | 
PARKER | It could be worse, right?
DAN (O.C.) | How the hell...could this be worse?Long pause...
R | laugh. It's uncomfortable and forced as hell. But it's alaugh.
LYNCH | Parker- coming through with the
A | tension breaker, look out! (to Dan) She's alright, Walker. Your girl is alright.He focuses on the task at hand again.
M | LYNCH (cont'd) OK...here we go.Slowly he pushes up on the back of the chair again. With onehand on Parker's shoulder and another on the back post of thechair, Lynch gets to his feet. Looking down at the drop, heinstantly crouches down again.
D | LYNCH (cont'd) Holy shit, is that high up.
PARKER | 
E | What can I do?
LYNCH | Nothing. Just be quiet.He psyches himself up again and starts to rise up.
DAN (O.C.) | You can do this, Lynch. You've got it.
LYNCH | Please stop talking.He puts one foot up on the top of the chair back...but itslips off to the side.
60. | LYNCH (cont'd) Woa-! The whole back of this thing is ice. Together, he and Parker start hitting the chair back.
CUT TO: | 
R | protection.
LYNCH (O.C.) | Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand on the back- I should
A | be able to reach the top. More chunks of ice shower down around Dan. Finally the falling ice subsides.
M | Dan takes his gloves away from his face...only to freeze in horror. Not even 10 feet away, stands a WOLF. Silently the wolf watches him from the bushes. Lightly growling.
E | DAN (cont'd) (really loud)
YOU GUYS! | 
CUT TO: | 
DAN (O.C.) | There's a wolf down here.
61. | Lynch and Parker look down. From their POV they can see that the wolf is standing right next to Dan, watching him. No fear.
PARKER | (gasps) Oh shit!
60   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                               60 | 
R | Dan doesn't take his eyes off of the wolf. He is shaking in fear.
DAN | 
A | What the hell do I do? The wolf sniffs at the air and then growls again, this time baring it's teeth. It smells the blood. DAN (cont'd)
GET AWAY FROM HIM!!! | The wolf steps back and snarls.
E | THWOCK! Parker's snowboard comes down and skids away into the trees, pushing the wolf further back. The wolf darts back into the bushes. Though it can no longer be seen, we can hear it moving away through the brush and back into the darkness. Growls come from the surrounding bushes as the wolf angrily retreats.
DAN (O.C.) | 
X | Yeah. I'm alive. Lynch slides his remaining pole in between the bars on the chair back and rests it there.
LYNCH | It's just a dog. That's all it is.
M | He won't be back.
PARKER | Are you keeping warm down there?
CUT TO: | 
DAN | As warm as I can. (then)
E | I can't feel my legs anymore. Is that bad? I mean, it doesn't hurt as much...but that's bad right?
CUT TO: | 
63. | He looks closely at Parker's face. The tip of her nose andthe tops of her cheeks look as if there is black soot onthem. LYNCH (cont'd) Hey...go like this.
X | He motions wiping his face.Parker follows suit, but winces in pain.
PARKER | 
R | Ow! It feels like...like sunburn.Pieces of her chapped skin are stuck to her icy glove.
LYNCH | 
A | I'm not an expert but I think that's frost bite.
PARKER | What?
PARKER | I don't..I can't see anything. I
D | don't know, it's too darkShe starts rubbing at her cheek again.
LYNCH | 
E | No! Stop touching it. Don't touch it.
PARKER | But it itches now...
LYNCH | I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off.Parker is terrified. LYNCH (cont'd) Just try and cover your face. Try and stay warm.
64. | Staying warm is absolutely impossible. Parker hides herexposed hand deeper inside her wet jacket.Icicles dangle from the bottom of the chair and theirclothing.
DAN (O.C.) | 
X | (winded) You gotta move faster up there.
LYNCH | I'm trying man, I'm trying.
R | Lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair,which bends at an awkward angle.From above him we can see the long drop down, and as he
A | slowly starts to maneuver his body up to the top of the chairarm- the height looks `stomach droppingly' scary.
PARKER | Careful.
DAN (O.C.) | Lynch. I think the-
D | Silence.Lynch gets his gloved hands around the top of the cable. Itis frozen over with a thick layer of ice.
E | The distance to the next chair seems about 10 times as farnow. LYNCH (cont'd) (to himself) I can do this. If Jenny Bluth could climb the rope, I can totally do this.Slowly, he wraps his arms around the wire, now with his fullbody weight on the back of the chair.The bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts tocreak. It bends slightly, but seems to hold firm.
65. | LYNCH (cont'd)
OK.    OK.   OK. | He starts to pull himself up onto the cable.
PARKER | Don't look down.
X | With one hand in front of the other, Lynch hoists himselfabout two feet off of the chair and into the air.
LYNCH | 
R | (gritted teeth) Slippery.
PARKER | Do you got it?
M | The cable clangs somewhere to the front and back of Lynch.The noise is almost refreshing in the silent ice coveredwilderness.With another deep breath, Lynch moves another two feet outover the sky. He is straining hard.
D | Another two feet out. He looks down for the first time.He sees something that scares the shit out of him. LYNCH (cont'd)
E | Oh god.
PARKER | What's wrong?
LYNCH | Please no. Please no...He starts to pull himself back to the chair, quickly.
DAN (O.C.) | Come on, Lynch! You had it!Lynch gets his foot on the icy chair back and tries tobalance his weight on it.
66. | SWISH! His foot slips off of it and he almost falls...but Parker grabs onto his coat.
PARKER | I got you. Lynch scrambles into the chair and huddles next to Parker.
X | PARKER (cont'd) What's wrong? He looks at her, icy tears in his eyes. His face is white.
R | PARKER (cont'd) What happened? Finally Lynch grabs her face in his hands. He gets close to
A | her.
LYNCH | Don't look down.
PARKER | 
M | What? He grabs her head forcefully, trying to cover her ears.
LYNCH | Don't look down there, Parker. The camera booms up and above them. As it tilts down at
D | them...we reveal Dan splayed out on the ground below. Out of the darkness of the bushes...a pack of SIX WOLVES slowly and silently descends on him from all angles.
CUT TO: | 
64   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             64 | Dan hears the first growl.
DAN | Oh shit. Oh shit. The hungry wolves circle around him. The smell of his freezing blood makes them drool.

D | Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses his forehead into hers. Her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves.
LYNCH | 
E | Shhhh. Don't listen to it. Don't listen. Don't listen. As we push in tight on the two of their faces, below them we hear the wolves begin their attack on their defenseless prey. First one growl and a bite. Dan shrieks in pain.
DAN (O.C.) | Don't let her look! Below we can hear him put up a fight. But the attacks and bites get more frequent and his screams even more painful.
68. | DAN (O.C.) (cont'd) Don't look! Don't you fucking look down here! The sound of several wolves attacking in unison over powers his cries.
X | Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan's demise echo through the night. The sounds of clothes being shredded, flesh being torn, and
R | bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain below. Dan doesn't scream as much as does cry out in pain and agony.
A | The camera never sees it. Only Lynch and Parker's faces. After what seems to be an unbearable minute...the sounds from below begin to dissipate. Eventually Dan's remains can be heard dragging away.
M | Silence once again. Finally, Lynch let's go of Parker's head. He sobs into his own frozen gloves as Parker hysterically screams out into the night.
CUT TO: | 
E | in the distance, birds take off in fear.

67   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MUCH LATER                                  67 | Lynch and Parker sit on the frozen chair, shivering. They are now in the devastating silence that has fallen after what must have been endless screaming and crying. Only the occasional sniffle lets us know that they are even awake. Finally Lynch breaks the silence.
LYNCH | I should...try and...
69. | He starts to try and sit up on the back of the chair again tocontinue his climbing effort.
PARKER | (emotionless) Why did you let him jump?
X | Lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief.
LYNCH | You can't be fucking serious.
LYNCH | He said he could do it. You didn't
A | try and stop him! (then) I can't believe this?! You're blaming me?
PARKER | 
M | I'm not...I'm not blaming you.
LYNCH | You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him!
PARKER | 
D | He wasn't going to listen to me.
LYNCH | Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I
E | said it was too far a drop! But I didn't hear any better ideas out of you except for crying about it! Don't you fucking blame me! You've been his girlfriend, for what? A year maybe? I've known him my whole fucking life!
PARKER | But you... You should have...
LYNCH | What? Say it.Parker looks at him, uncertain.
70. | LYNCH (cont'd) Say it! It should have been me?
PARKER | I didn't say that.
LYNCH | 
X | But you want to! It's OK. I get it. It should have been me down there cause who gives a fuck about me, right?
R | Parker feels terrible. She puts her hand on his shoulder.
PARKER | No, no, I-
A | Lynch shrugs her hand off of him.
LYNCH | You know what? If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass
M | we would have gotten some real runs in and we could have just gone home!
PARKER | I'm sorry.
LYNCH | 
D | You're sorry? Maybe if you hadn't fucked with our thing... maybe if you had just stayed home and not forced yourself into every aspect of his life... maybe my best friend
E | wouldn't be dead right now!
PARKER | That's not fair!
LYNCH | And it's not fair that my best friend is DEAD!Parker begins to sob.
PARKER | I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! I'm just- I'm just-
LYNCH | -Fuck you.
71. | Lynch is numb. He sits expressionless. Seething. In her crying, Parker slowly keeps moving towards him. Like a puppy who knows they did something wrong and only wants you to love it again. Finally she gets next to him and buries her head in his
X | chest, letting it all out. Eventually, Lynch can't help but feel compassion for her. He puts his arm around her.
R | LYNCH (cont'd) (quietly) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Parker.
D | They only speak to be speaking.
5020? | 
LYNCH | 5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call that girl when we get home. And you know what? I'm gonna marry her. No messing around. I'm just gonna be like "Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift. Will you marry me?" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve.
72. | Parker's face is expressionless.
PARKER | Who's gonna pay for the house.
LYNCH | She will. Shannon's got a great
X | job.
PARKER | What does she do.
R | Lynch makes something up...but continues to have no expression in his words. Despite his talk, his spirit is shattered.
LYNCH | 
A | She...an orthodontist.
PARKER | Orthodontists make a lot of money.
LYNCH | 
M | Yup.
PARKER | I bet you guys will be really happy.
E | of food" on the chair high above. Another wolf lays down in the snow by a tree. They wait like vultures.
69   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                               69 | Silence. Then...
PARKER | Who names their dog "Steve".
LYNCH | I will.
73. | 
PARKER | Steve's a "people" name.
LYNCH | Says who?
PARKER | 
X | You don't like walk into someone's house and have them say "Here's my dog Steve."
LYNCH | 
R | Why not? Steve's a good name for a dog.
PARKER | "Here, meet my cat Chris."
LYNCH | What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's?
D | Parker doesn't hear him. As she continues, wet snow startsto fall around them and the icy wind starts to pick up.
PARKER | 
E | The poor thing. She's just a puppy. She won't understand that I died. She's gonna think I left her. That I forgot about her. All she wants is for me to come home. She's probably waiting by the door for me right now. Every sound she hears in the hallway she's probably cocking her little head to the side, waiting to see if I'm going to walk in. But I won't. I won't ever walk in. And Shayna's going to starve to death. The poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting by the door for me and it's all my fault.
74. | 
LYNCH | She won't starve to death and you're not going to die.
PARKER | No one else has a key to my place.
R | (beat) And so will you. So will we.He puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying toshield the wind.
PARKER | Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. (then)
D | I want to see my Mom and my Dad. (then) I want to open presents in the morning and then wait for my grandmother to show up so we can
E | eat. She's always late. But she brings all of the desserts. And she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's so good. And after dinner my Dad always passes out on the couch `cause it's his one day off and he's had too much eggnog. And my sister, my Mom, and I watch A Christmas Story until the marathon is over. And that's how you know Christmas is really over. When Ralphie gets his Red Rider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming.
X | The camera pulls back wider and wider until their chair is lost in the wet snowfall and darkness. Slowly we fade to black as the wind howls and thunder gently rolls...
FADE IN: | 
M | together, but neither is moving. In fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both human popcycles. The dark splotches of frost-bite on Parker's nose and cheeks have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black fungus on her skin.
D | Lynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his ears and nose. Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens.
E | Her eyes search around as the realization that this was not all just a bad dream sinks in. She adjusts in her seat and feels something pull. She winces and looks down. Slowly the camera follows her stare down to reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar. She pulls...but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal. Beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar up about half an inch with it.
PARKER | Uhh...
76. | Painstakingly slow, she begins to peel her hand off of thebar.A sound that resembles `jeans slowly tearing' can be softlyheard as she moves her arm forward and separates her handfrom the skin that is attached to the metal.
X | After what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand onelast jerk, freeing it from the safety bar. PARKER (cont'd) Ruuugh!
R | Her movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts upright as iffrom a `falling nightmare'.Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth frantically
A | trying to get his bearings.Parker is crying and holding her bloody hand, PARKER (cont'd) Shhhh.
M | Lynch, bug-eyed, takes in the world around him.A fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inchesof peaceful white bliss.Below them, the snow has completely covered Dan's remains.There is nothing left to show that there was ever even a
D | struggle.Parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat, awayfrom Lynch's eyes.
PARKER | What?
LYNCH | Your frost-bite. It's getting...worse.She starts to touch her face.
77. | 
PARKER | Really? How bad is it?Lynch stops her.
LYNCH | Don't. It's bad.
LYNCH | 
R | Just don't touch your face, OK? When we get out of here, we'll get you to a doctor right away and they'll fix it.
LYNCH | They'll fix me, too then. Just
M | don't touch it.He looks around, front to back. In daylight it's easier tosee the other chairs.His breath blows out of his body in huge plumes of mist. LYNCH (cont'd)
D | Well, it's morning. Maybe someone will come up here now.
PARKER | For what?
PARKER | No one's gonna look for me. I skip class all the time. By the time anyone notices I'm gone I'll be dead.
LYNCH | Can you please just think ONE positive thing? Please!
78. | 
PARKER | Besides. No one knows we're here.
LYNCH | (to the sky)
HEL-LO!!! WE NEED HELP!!      HELP!!! | 
X | His voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as iftaunting him.He turns around to look at the chairs behind him.
R | LYNCH (cont'd) Alright. Look. If I can get to that chair...two back...I could make it to the ladder on that pole. I think I could make it down.
A | Parker doesn't speak. LYNCH (cont'd) Help me.
D | one is coming" but he decides there's no harm in waiting justa little while longer.Lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat ismaking it almost impossible to scream.
UP HERE!   SOMEONE HELP US! | Once again...only echoes.He re-settles in his chair.
PARKER | I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute.
LYNCH | If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you.
79. | 
PARKER | No. I can't.
LYNCH | Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this.
CUT TO: | 
M | An empty lodge. An empty parking lot. A still chair lift. All covered in white, still snow.
72   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                          72 | 
E | Lynch is sleeping. His head is leaned to one side in a position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's ever had. Parker is ancy. She looks all around. Thinking. Finally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed. Her snow pants turn dark around her bottom. Slowly a puddle of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch. Below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears. Parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her tears. She is emotionally degraded and devastated.
80. | As her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand across it...taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her cheek with it. She doesn't even feel it.
DISSOLVE TO: | 
R | Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still breathing. It appears she is not.
M | Nothing. LYNCH (cont'd) Parker wake up. He shakes her harder and she comes to with a gasp.
PARKER | 
D | What?
LYNCH | Shit, I thought you stopped breathing...
E | He notices her skinned cheek. Her ear tips are now completely blackened.
PARKER | What's wrong?
LYNCH | Nothing. She studies his eyes. Clearly something is very wrong. LYNCH (cont'd) How about you help me up again and we try and get out of here?
81. | 
PARKER | Yeah.
74   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                      74 | From beneath the chair we see shards of ice and snow fall
X | onto the ground. Lynch is once again trying to maneuver himself up onto the chair back as Parker holds him steady.
OK.   1...2...3- | He hoists himself up onto the cable briefly, but after just a few seconds, he returns his feet to the chair back.
A | Parker holds onto his legs tightly. LYNCH (cont'd) I feel like I gained about 100 pounds overnight.
LYNCH | I have no strength.
PARKER | 
D | Then don't do this. Lynch tries again. He hoists himself up, but bails instantly...like a trainer giving up on his 100th pull up.
PARKER | Maybe later.
LYNCH | What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength.
82. | 
PARKER | There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. Maybe the jump won't be as bad now.
LYNCH | Even if it was a foot deeper- it
X | wouldn't break that fall. I should have just climbed across last night. I had strength. I had adrenaline.
LYNCH | Nothing. Let's sit and do nothing.
A | She reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes. The box is damp, but the cigarettes inside are still dry. She starts to remove one but her gloved left hand and her numb right hand make her fumble the pack.
75   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                               75 | The pack of cigarettes falls into the snow.
AHHHH! | 
HARD CUT TO: | 
PARKER | How come you never have a girlfriend?
LYNCH | How am I supposed to answer that?
83. | 
PARKER | I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls dig you. But you never stay in a relationship.
LYNCH | I had a serious girlfriend once.
LYNCH | 
R | No, post-high school. Freshmen year.
PARKER | Who?
M | totally just felt it with her, you know? We were into a lot of the same stuff, which was cool. She was way into Aerosmith. I had seen them fifteen times, she had seen them twenty. How cool is that?
PARKER | 
D | What happened?
LYNCH | She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates
E | and that stuff you read about.
PARKER | So then... what happened?
LYNCH | Same old shit. (then) No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named "Dean" had left her notes and shit.
84. | 
PARKER | Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous?
LYNCH | I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention.
LYNCH | 
R | No. I dumped her. We were in the cafeteria, right? And I was sitting facing her, facing the wall...and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me. And I
A | kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like, almost laughing. So I was like, "who are you laughing at?" You know? Like "what the hell is going on?" And she's like, "Dean's making fun of
M | you." (beat) So I turn around, and I'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. And all I see is a sea of fucking random people. Just all of these faces. This guy could see me and was making eyes with my
D | girlfriend...but I couldn't see him.
PARKER | That's messed up.
PARKER | You just walked out?
LYNCH | Yup. Told her to go laugh with "Dean the Frat guy". I was out.
PARKER | That sucks.
85. | 
LYNCH | Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I
X | screwed up.
PARKER | You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that.
A | Emotion has fought it's way to the surface again. Parker andLynch share a nervous laugh together.She turns away from him.
M | After a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears.
PARKER | I should have done something.
LYNCH | There was nothing either of us could have done.
LYNCH | 
E | No, you didn't. We didn't let him die. There was nothing we could have done. He jumped down there to try and save us, OK?
PARKER | He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry.
LYNCH | Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little...
86. | Parker laughs. LYNCH (cont'd) Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass.Parker laughs harder.
X | LYNCH (cont'd) And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying
R | like a total pussy.
PARKER | Sounds like Dan.
M | says, "Well Dan, is there anyone else in the class that you know?" You know, like, "Maybe there's a friend you'd like to sit with?" And the fucker points right at me and says "him"! I had never seen this kid before in my life, you know? But for whatever reason, he
D | points right at me.
PARKER | And so he had to sit with you?
PARKER | I loved him so much.Lynch is determined.
87. | 
LYNCH | But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit.
PARKER | Yes.
R | for Dan. Alright?
PARKER | Yes.
A | Lynch bites his severely chapped lips.
LYNCH | Help me up.
CUT TO: | 
LYNCH | 
D | OK....let's try this again. He steadies himself on the chair, which sways in the wind. TIGHT ON the bolts connecting the arm to the cables. The
E | metal is bending with a light squeaking sound.
PARKER | Are you OK? Do you have it? Lynch just grunts as he reaches and tries to steady himself on the chair that is swinging at an odd angle under his weight. The camera swivels up to reveal his shaky feet trying to find footing on the chair back and the ground far below him.
LYNCH | Rrruh! He pushes off hard and grabs on to the cabling.
88. | As his foot pushes fast on the chair, it swings at animpossible angle.TIGHT ON the connecting bolts as one of them SNAPS!
PARKER | Oh my god!
X | The chair leans hard to the right side, forcing Parker toslide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair.The chair is still in place, but it is now hanging by one
A | Joe tries to look back over his shoulder, struggling to keephimself on the cable against his own body weight and wetclothing.
LYNCH | Shit! Hold on, just hold on!
M | Another grunt and Lynch makes another big move forward.The camera booms up above him, shooting straight down at thedistance between his dangling body and the frozen ground.Tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on themetal cable.
D | Lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward.Behind him, Parker looks on in agony. She is holding herbreath and whispering...
LYNCH | Rrrugh!
89. | 
PARKER | You can do it. Please do it.Lynch reaches forward again...and his hand slips on the icycable. He momentarily hangs by one arm.
LYNCH | 
X | Arrrrr!
R | He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.
LYNCH | (through gritted teeth) Got it.
A | Another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfwayacross to the next chair.From Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating abovethe earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. His own
M | pained breathing fills his ears.It's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching himfrom the bushes. LYNCH (cont'd) Motherfucker.
D | The wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back andforth as he momentarily rests. LYNCH (cont'd) I've got an audience.
E | Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duckback into the bushes.Her movement makes the chair groan harder. The cable twangsloudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metalthat holds the arm in place.
PARKER | The chair is gonna fall!
LYNCH | No. No it's not.Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positionshimself over the other chair.
90. | He drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading downinto the snow below.He quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sidesof the chair. LYNCH (cont'd)
X | Take that Jenny Bluth!
PARKER | You made it!
A | LYNCH (cont'd) Please.He stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable. He isweak.
M | Very weak. LYNCH (cont'd) Parker. I want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way.
D | She can't quite hear him.
PARKER | What?
PARKER | Oh shit.
91. | The pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distancebetween where she is and where the tree is. PARKER (cont'd) Sorry.
LYNCH | 
X | Hey. Halfway to me is better than up there with you, right? (to himself) Shit.
R | He starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to Parkerone more time.The chair has settled down.
A | LYNCH (cont'd) Stay perfectly still. I'm gonna get you home, OK?He pulls himself up, straining hard.
M | LYNCH (cont'd) Rrrrugh!This gets the wolves attention.In the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky,watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wirecable.
D | With reserved strength, Lynch shimmies across the cable asquickly as he can.Back at Parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt that
E | is keeping her from plunging to the ground.Tears stream down her face again.
PARKER | (whispered) Please god, don't let me fall. Don't let me fall.He stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving asquickly as possible.Finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and dropsdown into it.Looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearlysee that it wasn't as close to the chair as it looked.
92. | But it's possible.
LYNCH | Shit.Parker needs to yell to hear him now.
WHAT? | 
R | He assesses the situation.It's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladderand he is winded beyond belief.
WHAT'S WRONG? | 
... | 
LYNCH | (to himself)
OK. | 
D | The two stare at each other from the distance. Both of theirweather beaten faces are a mess.Parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to theground, holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady.
E | Stoically, Lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath.He climbs up onto the chair back and looks down.Parker closes her eyes and prays.The wolves below do not break their stare. Their hungry eyesare willing Lynch to fall from the chair.It's now or never. LYNCH (cont'd) Yaaaaugh!He throws himself off of the chair and towards the ladder!
93. | He lands and hooks his arm around a rung. With a SNAP his arm dislocates from it's socket, but he is hooked on to the ladder! LYNCH (cont'd) Rrrrugh!
YOU DID IT! YOU DID IT! | With his bad arm dangling by his side, Lynch works his way down the icy metal ladder.
R | Finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a THUD into the snow.
LYNCH | 
A | Oooof! The wolves' ears are at attention. They watch carefully from the safety of the bushes. One, the LEADER, takes a cautious single step forward and
M | waits.
ANSWER ME!!! | The wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk
D | towards Lynch's body. One step at a time.
CUT TO: | 
94. | The wolf surveys the situation and stops in his tracks. The other wolves watch from the bushes.
GET RESCUE. | 
79   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                    79 | 
CUT TO: | 
M | through it. He moves quickly back up to the area underneath the middle chair. The leader growls. Drool drips down from beneath it's hungry mouth as it takes a step back.
NO!   JOE! | 
E | The wolf leader advances on Lynch. Lynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it defensively at the creature. LYNCH (cont'd) Come on! Try something, fucker! The wolf stares back at him, growling. Their eyes are locked. Lynch swings the pole at it angrily. LYNCH (cont'd)
STAY AWAY! | 
SNAP! | 
X | A second wolf rushes Lynch from behind and grabs his injured arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth. LYNCH (cont'd)
ARGH! | 
R | The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill.
CUT TO: | 
JOE! | 
CUT TO: | 
82   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            82 | 
D | Lynch tries to fight off the wolf with his free arm. Finally, he is able to plunge the ski pole deep into the wolf's body.
E | The wolf SHRIEKS in pain and scampers away towards the safety of the pack. The impending wolves, stop their slow march and wait. This food still has some fight left in it.
ME! | He moves as fast as he can towards the area under Parker's chair, swinging his weapon like a madman all the while. The wolves only stare.
96. | Finally, he reaches the area and grabs Dan's snowboard, still sticking up in the snow. LYNCH (cont'd) Parker, I'm gonna go get help! Don't move and I'll be back as fast as I can!
X | Parker sobs.
A | his body on top of it. Pushing off he begins to slide quickly down the hill.
CUT TO: | 
D | heard now. Parker sobs quietly to herself.
DISSOLVE TO: | 
85   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - NIGHT                                      85 | Parker is not moving in her chair.
FADE TO BLACK. | 
86   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MORNING                                    86 | 
R | The morning sun hits Parker's pale face. Is she dead? Parker opens her eyes. She must have drifted off for the night. She looks to the tree-line around her.
A | The sun is coming up. She tries to move her body to look back in Lynch's direction and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and cable noise.
D | She raises the safety bar. There is no more time to think.
E | She is going to die one way or another. Slowly, Parker turns her body around towards the seat of the chair. Holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side. CREEEEE-EEK! The lone metal bolt protests the movement and makes metallic threats to snap. Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is dangling below the chair. RRRRRUUUUUURRR! A gust of wind pushes against the chair, straining the arm.
98. | Parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight asshe inches her body even lower.Smoothly, slowly, almost there- SNAP! The bolt gives way!The chair lurches down at an even greater angle, sendingParker off of the side!
X | PARKER (cont'd)
AHHHH! | WHIRRR! WAP! No longer attached with the safety bolts, the
R | chair falls several feet and then stops. It is now hangingonly by the one weak thread of cabling that was used toinitially wire it to the main line.Parker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is
A | dangling fully beneath it.While it is still a long drop...her feet are now a good 10feet closer to the ground, if not more.CREEEEEK! The metal wire will not hold for more than a few
M | seconds. The chair is going to fall!Parker closes her eyes.All sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and herheartbeat.The camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does not
D | like this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in thewind.Slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall.
E | The camera inches closer in to her face from below.Her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally...She let's go.As her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finallygives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight downto the ground after her.
87   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             87 | THUD! Parker lands hard and sound instantly returns to her. She rolls to the side as the chair crashes down in her very spot.
X | She is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in years. Surveying the damage- her ankle is badly broken underneath
R | the side of the chair that landed on it. Her boot is at an unnatural angle. Adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it.
A | She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone. Parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can.
88   EXT. JUST OVER THE HILL - MORNING, CONTINUOUS                 88 | Parker comes down the hill, gaining some speed on her awkward coat/sled.
D | As she makes her way she spots a tree... with bright red blood splayed out in the snow around it. Cautiously she slows herself down.
100. | Quick shots of his jacket, his boots, and his gloved hand all flash before Parker's devastated eyes. She slows herself to a complete stop now. Not knowing what to do. One of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see Parker just a few feet away. It is the pack leader. Lynch's blood pools from it's jaws. It's ears go back and it growls loudly at Parker.
R | She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure. Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding. Parker and the pack leader lock eyes. Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food. Back to his family. Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain side. She is free.
DISSOLVE TO: | 
89   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - LATER                                 89 | Parker continues down the treacherous trail as the snow falls around her. Occasionally she hits bumps and turns that cause her to spill from her awkward coat/sled...but she pulls herself back on and continues to make her way down the hill stoically.
DISSOLVE TO: | 
90   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - LATER                                 90 | Parker reaches the bottom of the hill. Grunting and crying from the pain, she crawls over on her belly and begins to drag herself towards the parking lot.
101. | 
91   EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER                                     91 | Parker drags her devastated body into the street. Just as she gets there....
X | BEEP! A HONKING CAR races past with it's windshield wipers blaring. Narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty road. There are no more cars to be seen. She is alone.
A | All that she can do is clutch the ground. And then... Another car approaches in the distance. She holds her hand up weakly.
PARKER | Please. Stop.
CUT TO: | 
92   INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS                                         92 | A DRIVER (male, 50's) is cautiously driving down the wet icy road. He reaches down to adjust the radio. He looks back up to reveal Parker's body in the road in front of him.
93   EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUOUS                                    93 | He swerves with a loud SKID! Partially off the road in a skid, his car comes to a stop. Instantly he jumps out and runs to the body on the road.
DRIVER | Hey! Are you OK?! Hello! Parker is not moving.
102. | He runs over to her side. DRIVER (cont'd) Lady. Are you alright? Parker looks up at him and starts to cry with relief.
X | DRIVER (cont'd) Hold on, hold on- we're gonna get you help... He lifts her up into his arms and races her back to his car.
CUT TO: | 
94   INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER                                    94 | The driver drives frantically, speaking into his cell phone.
DRIVER | (into phone) I don't know. I found her laying in the road alone. Looks like she was in some sort of accident. Right outside of Mount Holliston. I'm taking her to you now.
95   EXT. CAR, LOOKING IN - CONTINUOUS                           95 | Through the passenger side window we see Parker's blank face. If we didn't know better, we'd think she was a rotten cadaver at this point. Reflected in the glass are the lights of a PAPA GINO'S restaurant store front that goes past. Her eyes blink at the sign.
DRIVER | Hold on, Ma'am. The hospital is 10 minutes away. You're gonna be OK. The camera is tighter on her eyes. DRIVER (cont'd) You're gonna be OK. Tight on just one eye.
103. | DRIVER (cont'd) (now in Dan's voice) You're gonna be OK, baby.Her eye closes.
